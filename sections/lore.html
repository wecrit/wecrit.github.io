                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Astral Sea is one of the four parallel planes, though it is perhaps the least spacially coherent of the parallel planes.  Together with the ethereal plane and the prime material, the Astral Sea comprises the conceptual space of the mind in the mind-body-soul triangle of self.</p>

                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Astral Sea mirrors the prime material plane as well as many other planes of existence, as its geography is completely determined by how sapient beings concieve of the world.  Real-world landmarks may exist in this plane, but can be diminished or exaggerated depending on how people regard such a landmark.  Vast expanses of space between cities may not exist if people don't know the wilds between, and travel by road is usually slower due to this.  Many of the creatures which reside in this plane are born from the thoughts and imagination of sapient beings, such as the beholder-kin born of nightmares.</p>

            <h3 id="The Eladrin">The Eladrin</h3>

            <div class="lore_entry">

                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first thing that you notice as you are looking through the lore 
                and history of the Eladrin people, is that they are always referred to
                as the indigenous people of the land.  There are many many references
                to the "Gifts of the Eladrin", as well as mention of the grand Eladrin
                city, simply referred to as the "Elf Spire", but most of what you find
                at first is just too vague to glean concrete details from.

                </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eladrin are distinct from their other Elven bretherin, in that they 
                are classically denizens of the Feywild, a plane of positive emotion
                which lies parallel to the prime material plane.  The text somewhat
                pejoratively describes their features as cartoonish, larger-than-life,
                and full of passion.  This text also seems to refer to them as the
                "Original Elves" or "Progenitor Elves".

                </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Much of the information about the Eladrin is fairly obscure, but most
                of the texts seem to refer to the meeting between the Eladrin and the
                "First Men" after an event known as the "Exodus".  It also describes
                that roughly 100 years post-Exodus, the Eladrin become opressive lords
                over the first men, who would later rise up to throw off the throngs 
                of the Eladrin and become an independent state.

                </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Records indicate that the rule of the Eladrin is in the form of a 
                Kingdom, where a monarch or a small group of holy rulers, usually
                a chosen Eladrin and their life partners, head the state of the 
                Eladrin people.  It is said that the ruler of the Eladrin is annointed
                as a holy warrior, and is given reverence similar to that of the Elven
                Gods.  Interestingly, it seems that this seat of power has always been
                located within the Feywild, and that the Eladrin residing in the prime
                material plane were considered pioneers and wanderers.  Another small 
                tidbit you get from this tome is that the hierarchy of the Eladrin is 
                not very strict outside of the monarch, and entire batallions are left
                to operate independently, commanders simply trusting their 
                subordinates to follow their hearts and do what they believe is right.</p>

            <h3 id="The Feywild">The Feywild</h3>

            <div class="lore_entry">
                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Feywild is one of the four "parallel" planes, resting along-side,and in conjunction with the prime material plane. It is said that the Feywild is a manifestation of positive emotion, and embraces the genesis of all life. This is in stark contrast with its opposite parallel plane; the Shadowfell, which is said to be negative emotion manifest, and home to legions of undead.</p>
                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A very common thread throughout depictions of the Feywild are warnings about the capricious nature of the plane. While it is overflowing with life and positive emotion, these taken to excess bring ruin to those who travel to the plane unprepared. There are many tales here; from becoming eternally lost due to the mischief of pixies and sprites, to spontaneous dance parties where unwilling participants dance until they expire.</p>

                <h4>Zvidal, 20 Kovimer, 2612 PEC</h4>

                <p>This journal is a proclamation. I refuse to listen to the tired wisdom of my mentor. His methods, while reliable, fail to kindle the spark of genius needed to bring the art to the next level. I solemnly swear this day that I will build on "Archmage Champion" Kont's teachings and produce a specimen of such caliber that even his divine strikes fall as but feathers against its flesh.</p>
                <p>Today I leave Lucav to find a suitable locale to continue my studies, and to prove to him, and the world, that progress requires sacrifice.
                </p>

                <h4>Seldal, 23 Kovimer, 2612 PEC</h4>

                <p>Today I returned home, the ever-present stinging stench of fish falls upon this sleepy village as it ever has. Such a droll place, but Selia would not let me hear the end of it if I didn't come visit. So little does she understand me, though I know she means well. I am destined for much greater than what this fisherman's town can provide. She insists I stay for Year's Passing, and I suppose it is but two days.</p>
                <p>Still, there is much work to do...</p>

                <h4>Karadal, 5 Kovuns, 2613 PEC</h4>

                <p>Many days have passed as I search for a reclusive location to practice my art. The King's Road has far too much traffic; traveling merchants and scabby little peasant boys have left no room to study. I think for most, it would be well to kill them and give them some purpose as my guard. Still, I need to avoid any attention.</p>

                <h4>Tavoldal, 19 Kovuns, 2613 PEC</h4>

                <p>Nearly two weeks with only one promising location. Too many close calls; however, and I tire of the prying stare of each stranger. One saw me raise a deer as practice, so reports of my art are spreading. Had to pass through the capital, but I think I've thrown off any suspicions. Tensions in Elk's Crossing were far too high, and no-one in Triboar knows to mind their own mending. My stay in Westport has been too long, and I must press forward to find a new berth.</p>

                <h4>Vardal, 6 Kovanch, 2613 PEC</h4>

                <p>This is it!</p>
                <p>Finally, so few prying eyes. Rumors of trouble in Phandalin have kept the roads here relatively bare, and fortuitously, my supplies are freshly stocked. This small copse is home to a small, abandoned graveyard. It is perfect: out of the way, and plenty of subjects to test on. I do wish they were more fresh; however, the spider only gets the flies which come to it.</p>
                <p>So much work to do.</p>

                <h4>Hesdal, 10 Kovanch, 2613 PEC</h4>

                <p>Gods am I tired. I have recapitulated Artorious's teachings, re-implemented his practice, and effortlessly produced a small cadre of walking corpses. Faithful servants, though extremely dehydrated and quite weak... but why can I not refine the theory? I need to approach a new angle... I need some sort of necromantic catalyst. I had heard rumors on my way through Westport of a ruined town, Thundertree. A cataclysm befell the boar, and it was touched by the shadowfell. If I had just a bit of material, then perhaps...</p>

                <h4>Ersdal, 17 Kovanch, 2613 PEC</h4>

                <p>Took some time, and I am anxious at the thought of some soul discovering my impromptu lab; however, I finally hold in my possession some shadow-touched wood.</p>
                <p>It fills me with dread to look upon it, and I feel my hands tense as I grasp it, cold sweat accumulating in my palm. I understand though now, what terrible divine power I need to access.</p>
                <p>My path is set, my mettle is steel.</p>

                <h4>Tavoldal, 3 Benimer, 2613</h4>

                <p>Damn this wretched journey. Returning to my site and the mindless drones seem to eventually disobey, and two of the bodies are unaccounted for. I am sure I am far enough out that none will stumble upon them, but still, I've been unable to sleep this night.</p>
                <p>I am very dull, and of poor mood. Selia is far better for my absence. She would be better yet for my death.</p>

                <h4>Seldal, 7 Benimer, 2613 PEC</h4>

                <p>My raving was premature. Just as I promised, I have found a way to infuse the stuff of shadow into my rituals, and the revivified corpse glows with a dark energy. Temperamental at first, but I can still exert my will over it, and the wretch is not only obedient, but stronger than anything Artorious could muster. The method is actually unintuitive, and arose from an error in my calculations, but the results speak for themselves. Sometimes the road to greatness falls upon us, determined by destiny.</p>
                <p>I will take some respite, but soon, I will be ready to scale my efforts to several vessels. The only problem is marching them back to Lucav undetected...</p>

            <h3 id="Necromancy">Necromancy</h3>

            <div class="lore_entry">

                <h4>Schools</h4>

                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The school of Necromancy is an often forbidden subject due to the dark
                nature often associated with it; however, it is important to note that
                within this school, there are generally three very different types of
                effects.  The first is necrolyzation, which is the process in which
                life force is forcibly transferred, often used crudely to simply suck
                life out of a creature.  The second is animancy, or the process by 
                which corpses and other non-living vessels are animated, generally as
                undead.  The third, generally un-studied discipline of necromancy is
                so-called "White Necromancy", which deals in the preservation of the
                dead and halting decay of the body.</p>


                <h4>History</h4>
                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first thing you find within these texts are warnings against the
                lure of necromancy.  The first tale is about an ancient ruler of the
                Kingdom of Luftaerga, whose royal mage dabbled in the dark arts.  With
                this dark magic, the King was turned into an Undead creature which fed 
                on the flesh of mortals, but had the mind and countenance of a man.  
                It is said that decades of despair and ruin followed the rule of this 
                King.</p>
                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You come accross tales of necromancy used on the contentent and some 
                of the roots of the stigma against necromancy.  It seems that 
                necromancy is often associated and conflated with the "original sin", 
                which precipitated in the event known as the Exodus.  It says in here
                that an ancient ruler of a far-off land turned themselves into a Lich 
                and that land was left barren and desolate, with only a handful of
                survivors fleeing across the ocean to arrive in Arkovia.  Due to this, 
                any form of necromancy is strictly forbidden in the new world.</p>
                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You find a couple more stories, pouring over these volumes.  The first
                tells of the bloody wars in Arkovia which ravaged the lands towards 
                the start of the second era.  You see it references the Hallows as a 
                land "awash with death, the ground soaked in blood, harboring hordes 
                of Dwarf, Ashen, and Goliath Necromancers, raising armies of the 
                dead.".  This text seems to villanize these necromancers, and goes 
                into details about their brutal persecution and punishment after man 
                was victorious over their foes.  The second story detailed here 
                describes a cult which existed in the later parts of the second era.  
                This cult was said to worship a deity residing within the Shadowfell, 
                whose goal was to punish the wealthy and sinful ruling class, 
                unleashing so-called "Shadowforms" of manifested negative emotion 
                against them.  These conjoured Undead were said to have caused 
                widespread death and ruin, as they ravaged the land beyond the control
                of their summoners.  The text never states the name of the deity this 
                cult worshipped, but notes that all worship of this deity is forbidden
                and punishable by death.  It is now believed years after the fact, 
                this faith, and the associated deity, have been effectively eradicated.</p>
                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You find more details about one of the earliest stories you discovered
                on Necromancy.  It's the story of Saren Markova I, who was one of the
                most influential Kings of Luftaerga.  Under his rule, much of the land
                was unified under human banners, and in fact, his rule is said to 
                signify the transition into the current third era of man; however, 
                his Vizier, Alzena Grimleal, delved into dark magic and made contact
                with a Devil Prince; Kalthax the Binder.  Entering into an irrevocable
                contract, Saren Markova's soul was forfieted to the Prince, and the
                first of the Vampires was born.  The death of the Vampire King would 
                come at the cost of creating the first Markova Tree, and the threat of
                vampirism still looms over the land to this day. </p>

            <h3 id="Orcus">Orcus</h3>
            <div class="lore_entry">

                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Orcus is typically depicted as a large, humanoid figure with the face 
                of a goat and blood-red skin.  Often he is emblazoned with skulls, and
                amidst pools of blood.  His is the domain of death, and is known as 
                the 'Lord of Undeath'.
                </p>
                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In most depictions, Orcus is shown carrying a sort of club or wand 
                with a human skull resting atop it.  It is said that Orcus is a 
                powerful spell-casting entity, able to instantly necrolyze the flesh
                of mortals.  
                </p>
                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Orcus is closely associated with ghouls; undead beings which are born 
                of chaos and evil.  These pawns are used in an attempt to establish
                dominion over both the Abyss and Carceri; however, the infinite nature
                of the Abyss eludes true rulership, as it is impossible to impose his 
                will everywhere.</p>

            <h3 id="Golemancy">Golemancy</h3>
            <div class="lore_entry">

                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Golemancy is a specific subset of magical study where a semblance of
                life is granted to nonliving material, generally fashioned into the
                shape of a vaguely humanoid shape.  The axiomatic tennats of Golemancy
                are: golems are not sapient, and have no free will, and golems cannot 
                harm their masters.
                </p><p>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While there are many paths to creating a golem, all forms of creating
                a golem involve animancy - a form of necromancy.  Usually, some 
                catalytic residue from a living creature is required in the creation
                of these automatons, whether that is the soul of a sapient being, the
                essence of a felled elemental, or a caged spirit being.  Usually the
                simplest method of binding such an essence to a golem is using Lyceum
                Crystals, which have inherent magical energy within them.

                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Golems make particularly hardy guardians, but can prove easy to 
                mislead and fool, due to their lack of critical thought.  Golems are 
                usually created with hardy materials such as stone or metal; further,
                due to needing to regulate and contain the entrapped soul energy 
                powering it, often boast impressive resistance to magical energies.
                If the core of the golem can be reached and placed under an anti-magic
                effect, a golem can often be rendered dazed or useless.

                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Typically, in the creation of a golem, its master forms a telepathic
                link with it, and is able to issue commands with just a thought.  If
                given an order, golems typically carry it out until new orders are 
                given.  If a golem's master dies, it typically carries out its last
                orders indefinitely, but occasionally, they will go berserk: the 
                the stored spiritual energy slowly taking over the vessel it is in.

            <div class="lore_entry">
                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most of the first things you find in these tomes are just warnings against trying to perform planar travel.  What is useful, however, is that it provides a good overview of the planes, organized according to
                a cosmological theory known as the "Great Wheel".  It talks of the 
                prime material plane and its four parallel planes; the Feywild, the 
                Shadowfell, the Ethereal Plane, and the Astral Sea.  It also describes
                another inner plane known as the Elemental Chaos, which is further
                subdivided into four subplanes corresponding to each base element;
                Fire, Air, Water, and Earth.  It then describes the outer planes 
                which align with opposing conceptual spaces of lawfulness and 
                morality.  Finally, it describes three final planes; a plane of pure
                positive energy, a plane of pure negative energy, and a plane beyond
                all of these concepts, which is referred to singly as the City of 
                Sigil.  Beyond all of these planes, there exists an infinite continuum
                of demiplanes which are all nestled within the various spaces between
                and betwixt the planes, simple referred to as the Veil or the Beyond.
                </p>
                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Actually finding information about travel, you see that the most 
                common way to travel between planes is to discover a planar portal.
                Portals can be either naturally-occurring or artificially constructed.
                Naturally-occurring portals exist where the veil between planes is 
                thin.  One such area of thinning provided here is relative proximity 
                of the Elemental Plane of Air within the city of Elspire.  It goes on 
                to describe methods for discovering planar portals, which generally 
                include divinatory magic and searching for natural leylines of power,
                which tend to point toward or converge on a planar portal.
                </p>
                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This book talks about creation of temporary portals using high-level
                spellcasting techniques.  It covers a broad range of spells from the 
                Gate spell to the Planeshift spell, but by the descriptions given 
                here, it is both difficult and expensive to gather the components 
                necessary for these spells.  It does mention; however, the special 
                significance of the city of Sigil.  Sigil is known as a central hub 
                of travel and interplanar commerce where few mortals of the material
                plane have traveled.  Within the city of Sigil lies the Planar 
                Causeway; a temple of sorts with circles of teleportation leading to 
                all other known major planes.
                </p>
                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You find a book which discusses how to create a permanent portal 
                between planes.  There are two methods given, the first includes using
                powers of the divine to tear open a passageway between planes.  This 
                method is only ever recorded in legends and as far as anyone knows, no
                mortal has actually observed this process.  The other, more practical 
                method, is to either use planar teleportation magic in the same 
                location for an extended duration (resulting in the creation of a 
                permanent teleportation circle), or by continually wearing away the 
                veil between the two planes.  For example, in a location on the 
                material plane thinly veiled from the Feywild, a group of shamans 
                gathering and continually channeling fey-based spells would, over 
                time, wear down the barrier between the planes.  Usually these spells
                are directed toward some object or structure which is to become the 
                planar portal, but this process can be quite long and arduous.
                </p>
                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You find another tome discussing an evidently unproven hypothesis on 
                planar travel which posits that it should be possible to create
                planar causeways.  While the theory itself and symbols are 
                extraordinarily obscure and confounding, given some of the diagrams 
                and supporting text, it seems like the idea is that the infinite space
                between the planes known as the Veil could be bent into what appears
                to be a mobius ring shape.  THe closing statements state that, were 
                such a causeway to be created, it would actually cause the two planes 
                of existence to coincide, effectively creating not just a portal, but 
                a potentially large swatch of space which exists within both planes 
                simultaneously, and would allow free travel of both inhabitants and 
                energies between the two.
                </p>
                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You begin reading a tome on the topic of planar pilgrimage, and how 
                in recorded legends and myths, entire peoples have moved from one 
                plane to another, citing the example of the egress of the Eladrin 
                from the plane of Arborea.  Investigating methods for such mass 
                transport, scholars posit that it may be possible to craft a network
                of Planar Crest Stones, which can create a sort of planar bubble,
                almost like a makeshift planar craft which can travel through the Veil
                from one plane to the next.
                </p>
                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You uncover some obscure studies on the nature of the Veil, but most 
                of this seems like unsubstantiated conjecture and there is a great 
                deal of incomprehensible scribbling and formulas drawn within the 
                margins of this book.  What you glean from this is the idea that the
                Veil itself is extremely dangerous to all forms of life, and that if 
                any creature were stranded within the Veil, it would almost certainly
                perish.  It also states that the Veil is the true realm of the Gods, 
                where their actual beings exist; meanwhile, the manifestations of 
                a Gods Avatar, such as those found on the outer planes, is more akin
                to the God pushing a hand through the veil to interact with the
                universe.  The thesis statement of the book is that the true form of 
                the Gods is unknowable, and completely alien to mortal minds.  This 
                book also posits that throughout the Beyond exists not just the Gods 
                revered by mortals, but beings of untold cosmic strength which 
                constantly assail the Gods, searching for ways to push themselves 
                through the Veil and into our world.

            <div class="lore_entry">
                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The topic of psionics is highly-debated among wizards, scholars, and
                practitioners of faith.  The mechanics behind the manifestation of 
                these powers are somewhat of a mystery; the only conclusive statement
                that everyone seems to agree upon is that, unlike magic, psionics do  
                not interact with the underlying magical current of the universe known
                as the weave.</p>
                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While psionics can manifest in extremely varied ways, just as magic,
                it is unique in that it does not interact with effects of the weave
                which would hinder magic, such as the effects of a Dispel Magic spell.
                Interestingly, some psionic abilities require exteme focus, just like
                spellcasting; however, no psionic abilities seem to require verbal or
                material components.  </p>
                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Typically, psionics manifest as the ability to read or alter thoughts,
                to create semi-solid planes of kinetic force, or to engender a force 
                acting upon an object in the world.  What is clear from every source
                you have is that psionics originates in the mind, and that a 
                consciousness is the key component for manifesting these powers.
                Psionics are unusable by and on unconscious beings, and cannot be 
                instilled into inanimate objects.</p>
