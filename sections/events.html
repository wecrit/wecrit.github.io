    <li> Zeig investigates the humanoid, which turns out to be <a href="https://southpark.fandom.com/wiki/ManBearPig_(character)">ManBearPig</a> (MBP)! </li>

    <li> We discover that MBP was a hobgoblin, and a member of the Cragmaw.</li>

    <ul>
        <li> He tells us about the Cragmaw leader, King Grol, who resides in a keep. <a href="npcs.html#Rockseeker">Gundren</a> is being held there.</li>
        <li> He knows <a href="npcs.html#The Spider">Spider</a> works with the King, but can't tell us any more about <a href="npcs.html#The Spider">Spider</a>.</li>
        <li> He gives us directions to the keep, and tells us it's about half a day's distance. We decide he should lead us to the keep, in part because his directions sound very crazy.</li>
        <li> We travel toward the keep for some time, then decide to find a place to camp for the night.</li>
        <li> In the morning, we decide our captive's name is Spike, and convince him to like it. (His real name was Gul'then).</li>

<h2><span id="Cragmaw Keep">Cragmaw Keep</span></h2>
<ul>
    <li> Spike leads us to a secret entrance in the back of the keep. The entrance is camoflaged using a tapestry.</li>
    <li> We enter a room with two doorways, one covered only by a curtain. Something or someone moves in the room behind the curtain, but Spike says the other doorway leds to <a href="npcs.html#Rockseeker">Gundren</a>.</li>
    <ul>
        <li> <span class="combat">The door opens, and we end up face-to-face with a goblin. A goblin ranger shoots an arrow at <a href="party.html#Rasputin">Rasputin</a>, but he deflects it and injures another goblin.</span></li>
        <li> <span class="combat">An elf-like creature joins the fight. As combat unfolds, the creature's skin changes, and we realize it is not an elf at all. <a href="party.html#Un-Kell">Ün-Kell</a> kills whatever it is.</span></li>
        <li> <span class="combat">King Grol, disturbed by the commotion, also joins the fight. He knocks <a href="party.html#Nassirra">Nassirra</a> unconcious.</span></li>

    <li> We find an unconscious humanoid in the room, and discover that it is a wounded <a href="npcs.html#Rockseeker">Gundren</a>. A joyful reunion takes place. <a href="party.html#Zieg">Zieg</a> heals <a href="npcs.html#Rockseeker">Gundren</a>'s wounds and offers him a drink from his flask.

    </span><li> <span id="01/13/2018"> <a href="party.html#Un-Kell">Ün-Kell</a>, <a href="party.html#Zieg">Zieg</a>, and <a href="party.html#L">"L"</a> investigate the hall southwest of the room where King Grol was slain. <a href="party.html#Zieg">Zieg</a> and <a href="party.html#L">"L"</a> can hear arguing in a room further south. <a href="party.html#Un-Kell">Ün-Kell</a> asks Spike what room is south of them, where the sound appears to be coming from. Spike replies that it's the kitchen. <a href="party.html#L">"L"</a> and <a href="party.html#Zieg">Zieg</a> decide to investigate. <a href="party.html#Multimodal">Multimodal</a> decides to folow, with <a href="npcs.html#Rockseeker">Gundren</a> in tow.</li>
    <ul>
        <li> As <a href="party.html#Un-Kell">Ün-Kell</a> and the gang approach the kitchen, the sounds of combat become increasingly noticeable. </li>
    </ul>
    <li> Meanwhile, <a href="party.html#Rasputin">Rasputin</a> decided to explore south east of King Grol's room. <a href="party.html#Nassirra">Nassirra</a> followed shortly thereafter.</li>
    <ul>
        <li> <a href="party.html#Nassirra">Nassirra</a> hears unsettling gurgling sounds coming from the south end of the building. Something seems to have noticed her presence. As it begins to ram itself against the wooden door separating the rooms, <a href="party.html#Nassirra">Nassirra</a> exits the room through the western door to regroup with the rest of the party. <a href="party.html#Rasputin">Rasputin</a> reluctantly follows. <a href="party.html#Rasputin">Rasputin</a> asks Spike what's behind the door and trying to escape. Spike says it is a creature that the goblins keep as a pet.</li>
    </ul>
    <li> The group moves further down the hall in the south west direction and encounters another door at the end of the hall way. <a href="party.html#Zieg">Zieg</a> decides to open it stealthily, and finds that the room is riddled with bloodied goblins and hobgoblins in various states of injury. He closes the door as the party decides what to do. </li>
    <li> Further north in the hallway is another door. <a href="party.html#Multimodal">Multimodal</a> listens to it and hears nothing. She then determines that the door is not locked, and carefully opens it. She discovers that the room has high vaulted ceilings, much higher than the other ceilings in the keep, and notices two serpentine figures in the rafters. She quietly closes the door and informs the others. When asked about them, Spike remarks that the creatures are also pets.</li>
    <ul>
        <li> The group debates setting a trap outside the kitchen door, where combat is obviously happening, but decides against it. Instead, the party forms a marching order with <a href="party.html#Un-Kell">Ün-Kell</a> in front and decides to engage whatever was lurking in the rafters. Before entering the room, <a href="party.html#Un-Kell">Ün-Kell</a> places a large rock on Spike's chain so that he can't escape, but also does not get caught in the fray. <a href="npcs.html#Rockseeker">Gundren</a> decides to recuperate in King Grol's chambers.</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
        <li> <span class="combat">The party pours into the room and catches the two serpents by surprise. <a href="party.html#Un-Kell">Ün-Kell</a> attempts to throw a javelin at one of them, and it hits, but does not wound it. <a href="party.html#Rasputin">Rasputin</a> and <a href="party.html#Nassirra">Nassirra</a> quickly discover that the monsters' stony hides are resistant to physical damage. </span></li>
        <li> <span class="combat"><a href="party.html#Zieg">Zieg</a> and <a href="party.html#L">"L"</a> are able to wound the creatures using damaging spells. <a href="party.html#Rasputin">Rasputin</a> and <a href="party.html#Un-Kell">Ün-Kell</a> ultimately are able to deal enough physical damage to the monsters, despite their stony hides. </span></li>
        <li> <span class="combat">The party dispatches the two monsters with relative ease.</span></li>
    </ul>
    <li> Spike took the opportunity to escape while the party was occupied. <a href="party.html#Zieg">Zieg</a> attempts to find him, to no avail. He takes the opportunity to check on <a href="npcs.html#Rockseeker">Gundren</a>, who is still safe, but has not seen Spike. <a href="party.html#Zieg">Zieg</a> then rejoins the party with <a href="npcs.html#Rockseeker">Gundren</a>.</li>
    <li> After combat, the party is able to investigate the room and determined that it is an old chapel. <a href="party.html#Nassirra">Nassirra</a> decides to explore further, and discovers an altar room, where two shadowy figures are hiding. The party also notices that the sounds coming from the kitchen have died down.</li>
    <li> The party separates. <a href="party.html#Un-Kell">Ün-Kell</a> explores a door on the south west side of the chapel. He carefully opens the door, and makes eye-contact with a hobgoblin on the other side. The hobgoblin and its goblin comrades prepare to fight.</li>
    <ul>
        <li> <span class="combat"><a href="party.html#Un-Kell">Ün-Kell</a> charges at the hobgoblin, and feels a strange tug on his leg, accompanied by an ominous clicking sound. Despite his attempt to jump away, he triggers a trap which causes the ceiling to collapse in a pile rubble. </span></li>
        <li> <span class="combat">The rubble pile is too high and unstable for the other party members to cross. <a href="party.html#Zieg">Zieg</a> attempts to clear the rubble, but does not succeed. He calls out for the other party members to help dig through the rubble.</span></li>
        <li> <span class="combat"><a href="party.html#Multimodal">Multimodal</a> shapeshifts into a large rat to cross the rubble. As a rat, she makes reassuring squeaking sounds in <a href="party.html#Un-Kell">Ün-Kell</a>'s direction, joined soon after by <a href="party.html#L">Bob</a>. She heals him and casts a spell to help protect him in battle. Eventually, <a href="party.html#Un-Kell">Ün-Kell</a> is able to defeat all but one of the surrounding goblins and the hobgoblin. The remaining goblin runs away in a northerly direction.</span></li>
    </ul>
    <li> <span class="combat">At the same time as <a href="party.html#Un-Kell">Ün-Kell</a> began combat with the hobgoblin, <a href="party.html#Nassirra">Nassirra</a> and <a href="party.html#L">"L"</a> engaged the goblins hiding behind the altar in the church.</span></li>

        <li> <span class="combat">Several hobgoblins then burst through the nearby door and attacked the group, but they were defeated with relative ease. One goblin survived&mdash;the one who fled from <a href="party.html#Un-Kell">Ün-Kell</a>&mdash;and was knocked unconscious.</span></li>
    </ul>
    <li> The party explores the rest of the keep and discovers several items of interest: a quarterstaff (The Black Feather), and longsword and mail armor bearing the crest of the Lords' Alliance. </li>
    <li> Finally, the party decides to investigate the grumbling sounds <a href="party.html#Nassirra">Nassirra</a> and <a href="party.html#Rasputin">Rasputin</a> heard earlier. They bring the unconscious goblin along in hopes that it may serve as bait for the creature. Once the goblin has been placed in front of the door, <a href="party.html#Zieg">Zieg</a> opens it and runs off.</li>
    <ul>
        <li> <span class="combat">All members of the party ready attacks for when the creature attempts to burst through the door. Due to the size of the creature, an owlbear, it remains trapped in a choke point and is defeated easily.</span></li>
        <li> <span class="combat">The party leaves the unconscious goblin face down in a pile of owlbear droppings, because we are terrible.</span></li>
        <ul>
            <li> We have a change of heart and decide to turn the goblin's head so that he doesn't suffocate in a poop puddle.</li>

<h2><span id="Gundren Returns to Phandalin">Gundren Returns to Phandalin</span></h2>
<ul>
    <li> The party travels west along the main road and marches on until nightfall. We find a boar to eat and give <a href="npcs.html#Rockseeker">Gundren</a> his first real meal in days.</li>
    <ul>
        <li> After eating some food, <a href="npcs.html#Rockseeker">Gundren</a>'s spirit returns and he tells us more about Wave Echo Cave. Nearly two weeks prior, he and his brothers followed the map, and at first found nothing. Then, they began to dig, until the ground opened up beneath them and revealed a tunnel. Though the tunnel was too dark to see into, <a href="npcs.html#Rockseeker">Gundren</a> knew it was the right place because he could hear the echoes of crashing waves. He had not seen his brothers since.</li>
        <li> We set up camp near an intersection and rest. <a href="party.html#Rasputin">Rasputin</a> takes the first watch of the night, followed by <a href="party.html#Zieg">Zieg</a>, and <a href="party.html#Nassirra">Nassirra</a> and <a href="party.html#Un-Kell">Ün-Kell</a> share the last watch.</li>
    </ul>
    <li> As the group approaches the familiar outer wall of the city, <a href="party.html#Rasputin">Rasputin</a> notices that something is amiss up ahead. A large group of people are standing on the road. Among them are men and women clad in plate armor, and bald men in flowing white robes. We recognize the armored folk as members of the Scarlet Vigil, and the men in white robes as members of the Silver Council. Together, they are Sentinels of the Spire, a group from Elspire charged with peacekeeping. </li>
    <li> We notice that the road leading to the Edermath Orchard is lined with prison carts. Suspiciously, the carts are attached to golems exactly like the golems the party encountered in the catacombs under Tresendar Manor.</li>
    <li> Before we can investigate further, we are approached by a member of the Scarlet Vigil, who asks about our business in Phandalin. We point to <a href="npcs.html#Rockseeker">Gundren</a> and explain that we have been escorting him back to the town. The guard is similarly vague about what the Sentinels of the Spire are doing in Phandalin. </li>
    <ul>
        <li> As we speak to the guard, a dragonborn member of the Scarlet Vigil approaches us, and introduces himself as Sir <a href="npcs.html#Razak">Razak</a> Guldarzadarian. He is displeased with our story and claims to have received reports from trusted sources that describe our party as disturbers of the peace in Phandalin. When we explain that some misunderstanding must have occurred, and that <a href="npcs.html#Sildar">Sildar</a> should be able to help clear things up, he escorts us to the Townmaster's Hall for further inquiry.</li>
    </ul>
</ul>

<h3><span id="Townmaster's Hall">Townmaster's Hall</span> </h3>
<ul>
    <li> In the Townmaster's Hall, we notice <a href="npcs.html#Sildar">Sildar</a> speaking to a cloaked and bearded man who we have not seen before. The man is wielding what appears to be a glass staff. The party immediately realizes that this is <a href="npcs.html#Glasstaff">Lord Albrek</a>, also known as <a href="npcs.html#Glasstaff">Glasstaff</a>. <a href="npcs.html#Sildar">Sildar</a> seems to be unaware that his companion is the leader of the Redbrands.</li>
    <li> <a href="npcs.html#Sildar">Sildar</a> sees <a href="npcs.html#Rockseeker">Gundren</a> and expresses genuine happiness and relief upon seeing his friend alive. <a href="npcs.html#Rockseeker">Gundren</a> wants to greet <a href="npcs.html#Sildar">Sildar</a>, but is stopped by a guard. Lord <a href="npcs.html#Razak">Razak</a> explains his suspicions and asks <a href="npcs.html#Sildar">Sildar</a> whether our account of events is true.</li>
    <ul>
        <li> <a href="npcs.html#Glasstaff">Lord Albrek</a> chimes in to say that our party fits what he claims to have seen before he "fled for his life". He claims that we murdered innocent citizens of Phandalin in cold blood.</li>
        <li> <a href="party.html#L">"L"</a> very convincingly explains that the so-called citizens were actually Redbrands, bandits who had been terrorizing the good people of Phandalin, and who attacked us unprovoked. We were simply defending ourselves.</li>
        <ul>
            <li> <a href="npcs.html#Sildar">Sildar</a> acknowledges that we killed the citizens, but adds that he believes our story about the altercation: that the "citizens" were indeed Redbrands who started the altercation in the first place, and we only acted in self defense. However, because he was not an eye witness to the event, he is unable to corroborate our story.</li>
        </ul>
        <li> Lord <a href="npcs.html#Razak">Razak</a> asks whether we have witnesses who can confirm our story. We volunteer the blacksmith, Baerin Lodesoot, and the woman we rescued from Tresendar Manor, Mirna. <a href="npcs.html#Sildar">Sildar</a> leaves to find the witnesses and bring them back to the Townmaster's Hall for questioning.</li>
        <li> When <a href="npcs.html#Sildar">Sildar</a> returns with the witnesses, they confirm our account of events, and Lord <a href="npcs.html#Razak">Razak</a> seems satisfied with our story. He further notices that <a href="npcs.html#Glasstaff">Lord Albrek</a>'s story and the story he has heard from us and the witnesses do not add up, and that there are holes in <a href="npcs.html#Glasstaff">Lord Albrek</a>'s story. When <a href="npcs.html#Glasstaff">Lord Albrek</a> fails to convincingly defend himself, Lord <a href="npcs.html#Razak">Razak</a> confiscates his staff and takes him into custody.</li>
        <li> Lord <a href="npcs.html#Razak">Razak</a> asks us to stay in Phandalin proper for the next day or so while he continues to investigate. He gives us <a href="npcs.html#Glasstaff">Glasstaff</a>'s staff as a gesture of good will. We comply, and pay the Stone Hill Inn a visit.</li>
    </ul>
</ul>

<h3><span id="Stone Hill Inn">Stone Hill Inn</span></h3>
<ul>
    <li> We catch up with the innkeep, who asks what all the fuss is about, and whether it has anything to do with those pesky Redbrands we were inquiring about previously. The party decides not to divulge information about that. Instead, we whet our thirst and our appetites.</li>
    <li> After having some drinks, <a href="npcs.html#Rockseeker">Gundren</a> tells us more about Wave Echo Cave. In particular, he is concerned about his missing brothers, and the circumstances of his ambush by goblins. He suspects that someone was following him. He also does not understand why he was taken alive by the goblins.</li>
    <ul>
        <li> <a href="party.html#Multimodal">Multimodal</a> casts detect magic to determine whether the map has been affected by magic that might allow someone to track it. She finds nothing on the map, but <a href="npcs.html#Glasstaff">Glasstaff</a>'s staff emits a powerful magic aura. She determines that the staff is imbued with magic from the School of Abjuration.</li>
        <li> <a href="party.html#L">"L"</a> has spent enough time to attune to the staff, and discovers that it has properties that benefit a wielder of powerful magic.</li>
    </ul>
    <li> We briefly return to town to sell the valuables we looted in Cragmaw Keep, and to acquire some items that may be helpful to us when we venture on to Wave Echo Cave. Then, we return to the inn to retire for the night. But we are soon disturbed...</li>
</ul>

<h2><span id="Attack on Phandalin">Attack on Phandalin</span></h2>
<ul>
    <li> When the party prepares to settle in for sleep, however, we are disturbed by the sound of a loud horn. <a href="party.html#Zieg">Zieg</a> rushes to the window to determine the source of the alarm, and sees that the golem constructs leading the prison wagons have animated, and living bramble creatures have emerged from the forest.   </li>
    </span><li> <span id="03/03/2018"> <span class="combat">Sounds from battle can be heard in the distance, such as the cries of the wounded. <a href="party.html#L">Bob</a> is surveilling the battle and reports to <a href="party.html#L">"L"</a> that there is trouble outside.</span></li>
    <li> <span class="combat">Several patrons of the inn, including <a href="npcs.html#Rockseeker">Gundren</a> and Lanar, take shelter inside. <a href="party.html#L">"L"</a> sees a twig blight through a window and is able to destroy it with Eldritch Blast. The party leaves the inn one-by-one to determine what has happened, and to aid the town in combat.</span></li>
    <ul>
        <li> <span class="combat"><a href="party.html#Nassirra">Nassirra</a>, <a href="party.html#Rasputin">Rasputin</a>, <a href="party.html#Un-Kell">Ün-Kell</a> and <a href="party.html#Zieg">Zieg</a> are the first to leave the inn, killing several small twig blights and engaging combat with a needle blight. As these members of the party engage the enemy, more cries of anguish can be heard in the distance.</span></li>
        <ul>
            <li> <span class="combat">The needle blight, angered, directs its attack at <a href="party.html#L">Bob</a>, who does not survive.</span></li>
        </ul>
        <li> <span class="combat">Elsa, the bar maid at the Stone Hill Inn, also joins the party. <a href="party.html#Rasputin">Rasputin</a> advises her to return to the shelter of the inn, but she does not comply.</span> </li>
        <li> <span class="combat"><a href="party.html#Rasputin">Rasputin</a> moves closer to the source of the cries, and witnesses a horrible display. <a href="npcs.html#Glasstaff">Glasstaff</a> and his golems are fending off an army of blights that emerged from the forest, including blighted spiders the size of a goliath. <a href="npcs.html#Glasstaff">Glasstaff</a> is relatively helpless without the use of his staff, and has been immobilized by several blights. Soldiers of the Scarlet Vigil bravely try to fend them off, but many of them fall in battle despite their bravery. The blights are too much for <a href="npcs.html#Glasstaff">Glasstaff</a> to contend with, and he succumbs to their attacks. </span></li>
        <li> <span class="combat">The rest of the party makes its way outside the inn and we regroup to take on the blights. As we fight the blights, we notice that some of them&mdash;the blightans&mdash;are able to regenerate after appearing to be dead, seeming to siphon life from the earth below. <a href="party.html#Multimodal">Multimodal</a> begins igniting their corpses with Druidcraft to prevent them from regenerating.</span></li>
        <li> <span class="combat">Reinforcements from the Scarlet Vigil arrive, including <a href="npcs.html#Sildar">Sildar</a> and <a href="npcs.html#Razak">Razak</a>. Elsa, to our surprise, magically summons a blade and begins fighting alongside us, though she does so with caution. She uses frost magic to wound the blights. <a href="party.html#Nassirra">Nassirra</a> climbs onto the backsmith's roof and attacks the blights from afar with her bow. One blight breaks into the building and tries to attack the blacskmith, but he safely escapes. <a href="npcs.html#Razak">Razak</a> comes to our aid and empowers those around him while he attacks, creating a mysterious sensation of cold as he strikes.</span></li>
        <li> <span class="special"><a href="party.html#Zieg">Zieg</a>, using the divine energy of Pelor, casts Channel Divinity to combat several foes at once. As he does, he receives Pelor's blessing and becomes enveloped in radiant light. He is now <a href="party.html#Zieg">Zieg</a>, the Lantern of Hope.</span></li>
    </ul>
    <li> Eventually we manage to kill all of the blights, and assess the damage. We find dead bodies everywhere, including that of <a href="npcs.html#Glasstaff">Glasstaff</a>. Knowing that he was once quite powerful, we scavenge for useful magical items he may still have had in his possession. We find several gem stones, including a pearl, which <a href="party.html#L">"L"</a> eyes with great interest.</li>
    <li> We notice that one of the prison carts remains undisturbed by the blights. It contains the Redbrands we brought into custody previously. They sit fearfully in their confinement. We ask them whether they know anything about the attack, but they appear genuinely ignorant of the situation. </li>
    <li> Suddenly, we become acutely aware of Daren Edermath's absence during the entire ordeal. A chill comes over the party as we realize that the blights approached from the direction of his orchard. We decide to pay him a wellness visit.</li>
    <ul>
        <li> When we arrive, we see smoke pouring out of his cabin. <a href="party.html#Multimodal">Multimodal</a> quickly puts out the flames using Druidcraft, and the group clears the smoke from the cabin. </li>
        <li> When it clears, we are devastated to find Daren dead. <a href="party.html#Zieg">Zieg</a> inspects his wounds and determines that he died from the spines of the blights we just defeated. He had put up a fight, but was no match for the horde of blights beset upon him. </li>
        <li> As we search the room more, we find the corpse of Myrna, who had become his lover. <a href="party.html#Zieg">Zieg</a> closes her eyes and covers her with a blanket to give her some dignity in death. </li>
        <li> Knowing that Daren was once a member of the Scarlet Vigil, and had a history of skilled fighting, we further searched his dwelling and found a chest containing a magical cloak (<i><a href="party.html#Nassirra">Cloak of the Scarlet Vigil</a></i>), clasped with a jewel. Sensing that the cloak must be important, we decided to put it to good use. <a href="party.html#L">"L"</a> holds on to the cloak until we can learn more about its magical properties.</li>
        </span><li> <span id="05/06/2018"> <a href="party.html#Zieg">Zieg</a> and <a href="party.html#Multimodal">Multimodal</a> decide to give Daren and Myrna a proper burial. With the assistance of <a href="party.html#Rasputin">Rasputin</a> and <a href="party.html#Nassirra">Nassirra</a>, we bury them on the orchard near a fence. <a href="party.html#Rasputin">Rasputin</a> and <a href="party.html#Zieg">Zieg</a> say a prayer, and <a href="party.html#Multimodal">Multimodal</a> wishes them peace.</li>
        <li> <a href="party.html#Un-Kell">Ün-Kell</a> voices concern for Myrna's children, and a desire to let them know what transpired. We don't do anything to follow-up on this. </li>
    </ul>
</ul>

<h2><span id="After the Blight Attack">After the Blight Attack</span></h2>
<ul>
    <li> The party returns to the Stone Hill Inn in the early hours of the morning, exhausted. Toblin, the innkeeper, is nowhere to be found, and <a href="npcs.html#Rockseeker">Gundren</a> has already retired for the evening. We follow suit. Before going to sleep, <a href="party.html#L">"L"</a> summons a new familiar (<a href="party.html#L">Bob</a>), who makes chicken sounds. He is also able to uncover the magical properties of the cape found at Daren's home, which allows the wearer to fall slowly and suffer no harm from it.</li>
    <li> When we wake, we find <a href="npcs.html#Rockseeker">Gundren</a> at the bar, drinking ale for breakfast. He expresses his weariness at the difficult week he has experienced, but is happy to see us.</li>
    <ul>
        <li> We ask Toblin for breakfast, and he orders Elsa to get it for us. We recall her magical heroism from the night before, but decide not to bring it up, especially around the other patrons of the inn.</li>
    </ul>
    <li> From the bar, we can hear raised voices outside. <a href="party.html#Zieg">Zieg</a> investigates and observes that a crowd has formed in the town square. <a href="party.html#L">Bob</a>, who has been keeping watch, reports to <a href="party.html#L">"L"</a> that there appear to be two groups of townsfolk arguing with one another. All but <a href="party.html#Rasputin">Rasputin</a> follow <a href="party.html#Zieg">Zieg</a> into the square to see what the hubbub is all about.</li>
    <ul>
        <li> We are surprised to learn that the groups are arguing about our band of adventurers. One group believes we are troublemakers who have intervened without their permission. The word "outsiders" comes up several times, which suggests that they are offended by the diversity of our party. <a href="party.html#Zieg">Zieg</a> tries to persuade them that we are friends, not foes. </li>
        <li> The other group stands up for us, including Linene, but they too are unable to persuade the group who instigated the argument. They are unable to see reason through the lens of hatred.</li>
        <li> Lord <a href="npcs.html#Razak">Razak</a> appears and takes command of the situation. He stands up for us, and further uses his authority to dismiss the crowd.</li>
        <ul>
            <li> We note that the innkeeper's wife, Trilena, was among the group of racists who instigated matters. She retreats to the inn while glaring at us.</li>
        </ul>
    </ul>
    <li> After the crowd dissapates, <a href="npcs.html#Razak">Razak</a> approaches us with more pressing matters. </li>
    <ul>
        <li> First, he pulls a cloth from his pouch containing some items that his men found after the battle. When he opens the cloth, we see that they are prisms carved from strange-looking wood, covered in runes.</li>
        <ul>
            <li> <a href="party.html#Multimodal">Multimodal</a> uses her Firbolg magic to investigate. She discovers that they emit a weak magical aura from the <a href="lore.html#Necromancy">necromancy</a> school. She shudders in horror, as they are most unnatural objects.</li>
            <li> <a href="npcs.html#Razak">Razak</a> explains that the items were found among the remains of the blights who attacked the town the night prior. We are unable to identify the runes or tell him more about the purpose of the objects. <a href="npcs.html#Razak">Razak</a> plans to take them to Elspire to see whether any experts there could tell him more. <a href="party.html#Multimodal">Multimodal</a> cautions him to keep them secret, in case anyone in Elspire has ties to whoever or whatever orchestrated the attack.</li>
        </ul>
        <li> Second, <a href="npcs.html#Razak">Razak</a> reports that he and his men investigated Tresendar Manor, and confirmed our account of the events that transpired there. He expresses concern that many of the townsfolk were either complicit or directly involved in <a href="npcs.html#Glasstaff">Lord Albrek</a>'s plans, and that his death has left a power vacuum.</li>
        <ul>
            <li> He tells us that there will be an investigation underway, and that we will need to travel to Elspire to testify about what took place. He asks how he can reach us to coordinate that when the time comes. We aren't exactly sure where we'll be, and we need to see to other matters in the meantime. He decides to send a runner to pass his word on to us, and gives his sword (<i><a href="party.html#Un-Kell">Lawblade</i></a>) to <a href="party.html#Un-Kell">Ün-Kell</a>, knowing that the runner would recognize it as a gift from Lord <a href="npcs.html#Razak">Razak</a>.</li>
        </ul>
        <li> The last point he wishes to discuss in private. We return to the inn, and he asks Toblin to clear the area so that we can speak plainly.</li>
        <ul>
            <li> He tells us that the kingdom is at war, but the war has been kept secret from its people. There have been incursions from the south originating from the Fetid Tangle. Orcs and hobgoblins led by human sorcerers have been attacking the lands. The town of Triboar has been assaulted more than once. We ask whether <a href="npcs.html#Glasstaff">Lord Albrek</a> could have been one such sorcerer, but he does not know.</li>
            <li> He asks us to join the fight against the incursions. If we choose to do so, he tells us that we should meet with Captain Vilandris at Triboar, a high ranking member of the Scarlet Vigil. </li>
        </ul>
        <li> <a href="npcs.html#Razak">Razak</a> then bids us well, and departs for the battlefront. We wish him well and hope to see him again.</li>
    </ul>
    <li>  After <a href="npcs.html#Razak">Razak</a> leaves, Elsa brings us our breakfast. </li>
    <ul>
        <li>  We make some jabs at her, hinting at her involvement in the events the night before. <a href="party.html#Rasputin">Rasputin</a> asks her for pepper, with a heavy pause before his request in order to throw her off balance. <a href="party.html#Multimodal">Multimodal</a> asks her for ice in her beverage, and Elsa uses her magic to do so. When we ask her what last night was about, she said she was just doing what she could to help the town.</li>
    <li> <a href="npcs.html#Rockseeker">Gundren</a> expresses concern for his brothers, and we discuss our next moves. We decide to head to the place where <a href="npcs.html#Rockseeker">Gundren</a> and his brothers had last made camp after we have finished eating breakfast.</li>
    </ul>
</ul>

<h2><span id="Wave Echo Cave">Wave Echo Cave</span></h2>
<h3><span id="Level 1">Level 1</span></h3>
<ul>
    <li> We follow <a href="npcs.html#Rockseeker">Gundren</a> in our trek to Wave Echo Cave, which takes about a day. We follow the mountains and hug the coast to get there. <a href="npcs.html#Rockseeker">Gundren</a> has clearly traveled this road several times, and warns us about pitfalls along the way. </li>
    <li>Early on in our journey, he draws our attention to a point on the horizon where two mountain ranges meet, and explains that the cave is near that area. We eat rations and forage for food as needed during the journey.</li>
    <li> When we do reach the cave, we see a group of footprints in the area that seem suspicious to us. <a href="npcs.html#Rockseeker">Gundren</a> has no explanation for the footprints, believing that only he and his brothers had been this way. </li>
    <li>
        <a href="npcs.html#Rockseeker">Gundren</a> anxiously rushes into the cave, and we follow after him. </li>
    <ul>
        <li>In the entry chamber, we find three bedrolls and other evidence of a camp. Near the far wall there is an area of the ground that has caved in, opening into a tunnel below. Not far from the cave in, we find the body of <a href="npcs.html#Rockseeker">Tharden</a>, <a href="npcs.html#Rockseeker">Gundren</a>'s brother, wearing very flashy boots. <a href="npcs.html#Rockseeker">Gundren</a> mourns his brother.</li>
        <li>
            <a href="party.html#Rasputin">Rasputin</a> investigates the cave in further and discovers tha the tunnel beneath it extends both east and west. He jumps down into the tunnel, and the rest of the party follows. As we proceed along the curves of the eastern part of the tunnel, we find a large spiral-shaped chamber. <a href="party.html#Nassirra">Nassirra</a> senses the sound of waves crashing coming from below, and the sound of leathery wings flapping.</li>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <a href="party.html#L">Bob</a> investigates the room and reveals that the chamber has five exits, and spans at least two levels of the cave. The clockwise direction of the spiral goes upward from where we stand, and the counter-clockwise direction descends deeper into the cave. </li>
            <li>
                <a href="party.html#Rasputin">Rasputin</a> checks the stone door at the southernmost part of the room. He struggles to pull the door open before realizing that it needs to be pushed to open. Inside, he finds a long bare storm room.</li>
            <li> We decide to head back to the part of the tunnel immediately below the cave in and instead proceed west. We come to a fork in the tunnel, and take the southernmost path, which in turn splits into three different paths. A path that breaks off toward the east appeares to descend into a lower level of the cave, while the other two branches on the west side appear to ascend.</li>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <a href="party.html#Nassirra">Nassirra</a> investigates the upper branch on the west side, and sees a strange, unidentifiable milky mass. <a href="party.html#Multimodal">Multimodal</a> investigates, discovering that the milky mass seems to have a chitinous outer layer covering a living creature.</li>
                <li> We know that something killed <a href="npcs.html#Rockseeker">Tharden</a> and may have killed <a href="npcs.html#Rockseeker">Gundren</a>'s other brother, <a href="npcs.html#Rockseeker">Nundro</a>. We decide not to take any chances with these creatures, who may have been their undoing. <span class="combat"><a href="party.html#Zieg">Zieg</a> launches a spell at one of them and initiates combat. Two foes emerge from the milky goop and reveal themselves to be large insectoid creatures. They attack with a corrosive liquid, and can climb on the ceiling. <a href="party.html#Nassirra">Nassirra</a>, <a href="party.html#Zieg">Zieg</a>, L, <a href="party.html#Multimodal">Multimodal</a>, and <a href="party.html#Un-Kell">Ün-Kell</a> quickly dispatch them.</span></li>
                <li>Upon further inspection, we learn that the creatures were ankhegs, pests of mining operations. We observe that some of the tunnels in the cave have scratches all along the walls, and appear to be made not by man, but by these creatures.</li>
            </ul>
        </ul>
    </ul>
</ul>         

<h3><span id="Level 2">Level 2</span></h3>
<ul>
    <li> We follow the eastward, descending tunnel to see whether more of these creatures exist, and to purge the caverns of them if so. 
    <li> In the level below, we encounter another tunnel that spans from west to east. On the west end of the tunnel, <a href="party.html#Rasputin">Rasputin</a> discovers a waterfall. The party proceeds to the east end of the tunnel, where we encounter four more ankhegs. <span class="combat">We decide to exterminate them with an organized attack.</span></li>
    <ul>
        <li> <span class="combat"><a href="party.html#Zieg">Zieg</a> casts a spell to make the creatures vulnerable to all of our attacks. <a href="party.html#Nassirra">Nassirra</a> unleashes a barrage of arrows and thorns at the creatures, and <a href="party.html#Rasputin">Rasputin</a> and <a href="party.html#Un-Kell">Ün-Kell</a> batter them with devastating melee attacks. <a href="party.html#Multimodal">Multimodal</a>, <a href="party.html#Zieg">Zieg</a>, and <a href="party.html#L">"L"</a> summon powerful magic to combat their foes. The party suffers corrosive acid attacks, but survives. Two of the ankhegs attempted to retreat, but were killed by <a href="party.html#Un-Kell">Ün-Kell</a> and <a href="party.html#Nassirra">Nassirra</a> before they could escape. </span></li>
    </ul>
    <li> As we assess the aftermath of the battle, <a href="party.html#Rasputin">Rasputin</a> heads toward the southern end of the tunnel, but he is stopped dead in his tracks by a strange clittering sound he can hear coming from the south. Similar sounds also come from the east.</li>
    </span><li> <span id="06/09/2018"> We decide to regroup and plan our attack. Most of the party pulls back to the area where we descended from the upper level, which allows us to form a bottleneck. <a href="party.html#Zieg">Zieg</a>, opts to scout out the south tunnel, from which <a href="party.html#Rasputin">Rasputin</a> had just heard chittering sounds. </li>
    <ul>
        <li> He casts alight a piece of copper, then tosses it down the passage to illuminate whatever might be there. He sees another ankheg, and the bespoke creature subsequently melts the copper piece with acid, snuffing out the light.  </li>
        <li> <a href="party.html#L">"L"</a> comes to <a href="party.html#Zieg">Zieg</a>'s aid. The two decide to try luring the ankheg out by using an illusion. To that end, <a href="party.html#L">"L"</a> conjures the image of a figure that somewhat resembles <a href="party.html#Zieg">Zieg</a> further down the tunnel. One of the creatures attempts to attack the illusion briefly, but do not engage beyond that.</li>
    </ul>
    <li> <a href="party.html#Rasputin">Rasputin</a> investigates the part of the tunnel that branches east, where he had also heard sounds emanating from. He explores carefully and finds that the tunnel splits in two directions. To the north, he sees a wooden barricade that has been scratched and etched with acid. To the south, he can make out the figure of a very large ankheg standing on a cliff. </li>
    <li> Suddenly, <a href="party.html#Multimodal">Multimodal</a> and <a href="party.html#L">"L"</a> can hear the sound of burrowing insects moving in the tunnel walls around them. <a href="party.html#L">"L"</a> is able to move westward to get away, but several ankhegs emerge from the tunnel walls before the others can do the same. <span class="combat">They release a spray of acid onto the party, dealing heavy damage to us. <a href="party.html#Nassirra">Nassirra</a> is particularly compromised by the attack. <a href="party.html#Multimodal">Multimodal</a> uses healing magic to stabilize her, while <a href="party.html#Rasputin">Rasputin</a>, <a href="party.html#Un-Kell">Ün-Kell</a>, <a href="party.html#Zieg">Zieg</a>, and <a href="party.html#L">"L"</a> slay the creatures.</span></li>
    <li> The party briefly rests in the store rooom (on Level 1, dubbed "Helm's Deep" by <a href="party.html#Rasputin">Rasputin</a>) to recover from exposure to the caustic substance, and to strategize how best to take down what appears to be the queen ankheg. <a href="party.html#L">"L"</a> conjures an auditory illusion that creates a sound similar to what the ankhegs produce to communicate. <a href="party.html#Rasputin">Rasputin</a>, <a href="party.html#Zieg">Zieg</a>, and <a href="party.html#Un-Kell">Ün-Kell</a> plan to follow the branching passage south. <a href="party.html#Nassirra">Nassirra</a>, <a href="party.html#Multimodal">Multimodal</a>, and <a href="party.html#L">"L"</a> will attack from the passage that branches east.</li>
    <ul>
        <li> <span class="combat">We then begin our attack. <a href="party.html#L">"L"</a> injures the queen slightly with an Eldritch Blast, then <a href="party.html#Zieg">Zieg</a> weakens the creature using Fearie Fire. <a href="party.html#Rasputin">Rasputin</a> charges in and tosses a flask of Alchemists's Fire at the queen, but the glass does not break.</span></li>
        <li> <span class="combat">As we charge in, we realize that the queen was not alone in the chamber. Three ankhegs emerge and attack, one spraying <a href="party.html#L">"L"</a> with acid, and another grappling <a href="party.html#Rasputin">Rasputin</a> with its bite. <a href="party.html#Zieg">Zieg</a> assists <a href="party.html#Rasputin">Rasputin</a> in killing the latter ankheg, liberating <a href="party.html#Rasputin">Rasputin</a> from its grasp.</span></li>
        <li> <span class="combat">The queen becomes defensive, crouching in the back of its perch. It siezes an opportunity to spray <a href="party.html#Nassirra">Nassirra</a> with acid, to little effect, before returning to its defensive stance. <a href="party.html#Nassirra">Nassirra</a> then strikes the queen with a mighty attack from her longbow. In pain, the creature stumbles, breaking the vial of Alchemist's Fire that <a href="party.html#Rasputin">Rasputin</a> had thrown toward it earlier, causing the queen to become wreathed in flame. <a href="party.html#Zieg">Zieg</a> deals a death blow to the creature by emitting beams of raidant light from his hands.</span></li>
        <li> <span class="combat">Meanwhile, <a href="party.html#Rasputin">Rasputin</a>, <a href="party.html#Un-Kell">Ün-Kell</a>, and <a href="party.html#L">"L"</a> dispatch of the remaining ankhegs.</span></li>
        <li> We eplore the chamber behind the remains of the queen and discover egg sacks. <a href="party.html#Multimodal">Multimodal</a> sets to burning them, to prevent more of the abberations from developing, but <a href="party.html#Rasputin">Rasputin</a> steals one for himself in the hopes that he can find an interested buyer. He wraps it in the flesh of the queen. This is fine.</li>
        <li> We also find a magical Zivil Stone, which can maintain satiation and sustenance for its owner. <a href="party.html#Rasputin">Rasputin</a> thinks it would be a fashionable accessory, and decides to hold on to it for now.</li>
    </ul>
    <li> After exploring the rest of the southern tunnels, we decide to uncover what is behind the wooden barricade that <a href="party.html#Rasputin">Rasputin</a> saw toward the north. With <a href="party.html#Zieg">Zieg</a>'s help, <a href="party.html#Un-Kell">Ün-Kell</a> is able to knock down the barricade. On the other side, we find manmade halls that appear to be part of the lost mine. The party splits up to explore further.</li>
    <ul>
        <li> <a href="party.html#Zieg">Zieg</a> and <a href="party.html#Multimodal">Multimodal</a> head to the southwest corner, where they find a dead end. </li>
        <li> <a href="party.html#Nassirra">Nassirra</a> presses north, and comes across what appears to be a skeleton suspended in midair. <span class="combat">It slowly comes closer to her. </span></li>
        <li> <span class="combat"><a href="party.html#Rasputin">Rasputin</a>, who was further south in the same hall, comes to her aid. He charges at the skeleton and, next thing he knows, he has been engulfed by a corrosive gelatinous substance. The creature was not a skeleton at all, but a gelatinous cube. He manages to mindfully slow his heart rate before he loses consciousness, as the creature continues to digest him.</span></li>
        <li> <span class="combat"><a href="party.html#Nassirra">Nassirra</a> runs, shoots an arrow into the gelatinous cube, and watches as it dissolves inside the creature. She calls out for help from her fellow adventurers.</span></li>
        <li> <span class="combat">The commotion is enough to draw the attention of the rest of the party, who rush north to see what is happening.</span> </li>
        <li> <span class="combat">Once he gains a sense for the situation, <a href="party.html#Zieg">Zieg</a> yells for <a href="party.html#Nassirra">Nassirra</a> to keep a safe distance from the creature.</span></li> 
        <li> <span class="combat"><a href="party.html#L">"L"</a> creates an illusion of <a href="party.html#Zieg">Zieg</a> in the monster's path, as a diversion. The diversion successfully draws the creature's attention, allowing <a href="party.html#Nassirra">Nassirra</a> to escape southward down a hallway.</span></li>
        <blockquote><p>Illusion always adds 10 lbs.</p><footer>&mdash; <a href="party.html#Zieg">Zieg</a></footer></blockquote>
        <li> <span class="combat"><a href="party.html#Rasputin">Rasputin</a> manages to wake up and liberate himself from the creature, fleeing in a southerly direction, past <a href="party.html#Nassirra">Nassirra</a>.</span></li>
        <li> <span class="combat"><a href="party.html#Zieg">Zieg</a> attacks the creature with radiant light emanating from his palm, damaging it. <a href="party.html#Multimodal">Multimodal</a> casts spike growth, causing tangles and vines to cover the ground. <a href="party.html#Nassirra">Nassirra</a> launches another arrow at it, after which the creature begins to lose its form. As it advances on the adventurers, spikes from the vines dig into its flesh. After trying to move ten feet forward, the creature succumbs to its wounds.</span></li>
    </ul>
    </span><li> <span id="07/07/2018"> Weary from battle, the party decides to take refuge in the ankheg queen's nest while we rest for the night. <a href="party.html#Nassirra">Nassirra</a> casts an alarm spell to warn us if any creature approaches from the tunnels to the west. <a href="party.html#L">"L"</a>, <a href="party.html#Un-Kell">Ün-Kell</a>, and <a href="party.html#Zieg">Zieg</a> keep a rotating watch in case any threats approach from the mines.</li>
    <ul>
        <li> <a href="party.html#L">"L"</a> and <a href="party.html#Un-Kell">Ün-Kell</a>'s watches are uneventful. During <a href="party.html#Zieg">Zieg</a>'s watch, however, he hears sounds of motion and perhaps a voice calling out from the north, where the mining tunnels are. He is unable to make out the voice, and nothing else occurs during his watch.</li>
        <li> After everyone has rested, <a href="party.html#Zieg">Zieg</a> informs the party of what he heard during the night.</li>
    </ul>
    <li> We return north to explore the rest of the mines, including a stone door we encountered before the gelatinous cube descended upon <a href="party.html#Nassirra">Nassirra</a>. </li>
    <ul>
        <li> <a href="party.html#Rasputin">Rasputin</a> identifies the door as study Dwarven construction, but it is otherwise unremarkable.</li>
        <li> <a href="party.html#Nassirra">Nassirra</a> and <a href="party.html#Multimodal">Multimodal</a> check for tracks, to see who or what may have caused the noise <a href="party.html#Zieg">Zieg</a> heard during his watch. The floor is completely smooth, perhaps in part due to the caustic monster that had roamed the halls. They are unable to detect any tracks on its surface.</li>
        <li> We open the door and discover a second store room, similar to the one above (Helm's Deep). The room contains old, useless mining tools that are unsalvageable. They have been all but disintegrated due to the passage of time and the acidity in the air. It is pungent, and burns our noses. </li>
        <li> A thick layer of fine dust coats every surface in the room. <a href="party.html#Nassirra">Nassirra</a> and <a href="party.html#Multimodal">Multimodal</a> can detect that something has indeed passed through the room, but the dust is not packed enough to reveal footprints and identify the source.</li>
        <li> Across the room there is another stone door. <a href="party.html#Rasputin">Rasputin</a> and <a href="party.html#Un-Kell">Ün-Kell</a> initially struggle to open the door before noticing its handles, and then easily opening the door towards them.</li>
    </ul>
    <li> On the other side of the door we again encounter the spiral chamber, from one level below where we first discovered it. On the western side of the spiral we see a door, and to the southwest is the other ledge that overlooks the waterfall <a href="party.html#Rasputin">Rasputin</a> discovered earlier. We can still hear the beating of leathery wings from above, but the sound is more quiet. An acrid, pungent smell wafts up from the chamber below, very strongly. </li>
    <ul>
        <li> <a href="party.html#Zieg">Zieg</a> casts a copper piece alight and tosses it down into the chamber. Below, we can make out the form of a statue of some kind, and we see that the cavern floor is covered with some kind of fungus. A plant-like creature moves across the floor, perhaps in response to the light. </li>
    </ul>
    <li> We proceed through the western door, deciding to explore more before we descend further into the cave. </li>
    <ul>
        <li> <a href="party.html#Rasputin">Rasputin</a> presses an ear to the door, and hears some kind of commotion. There are certainly creatures waiting for us.</li>
        <li> He and <a href="party.html#Un-Kell">Ün-Kell</a> open the door, revealing some kind of dining hall with several substantial stone tables. The smell of old grease and bad food fills our nostrils. <span class="combat">As <a href="party.html#Un-Kell">Ün-Kell</a> enters the room, a bugbear emerges from an adjoining room. Upon spotting <a href="party.html#Un-Kell">Ün-Kell</a>, it calls for reinforcements. In total, six bugbears engage the party in combat.</span></li>
        <li> <span class="combat">The bugbear approaches <a href="party.html#Un-Kell">Ün-Kell</a> angrily. <a href="party.html#L">"L"</a> attacks it with an Eldritch Blast, burning away layers of flesh from its face. <a href="party.html#Zieg">Zieg</a> casts Sacred Flame and wounds several of the creatures. <a href="party.html#Nassirra">Nassirra</a>, adjacent to <a href="party.html#Un-Kell">Ün-Kell</a>, handily strikes the nearest bugbear with her swords, killing it. <a href="party.html#Multimodal">Multimodal</a> casts spike growth, covering the ground where the remaining five bugbears stand with damaging spikes. The bugbears attempt to move through the spike growth, but thorns from the ground embed in their skin, causing them pain and confusion.</span></li>
        <li> <span class="combat"><a href="party.html#L">"L"</a> and <a href="party.html#Un-Kell">Ün-Kell</a> take care of the next bugbear in line with an Eldritch Blast and radiant energy fueled by <a href="party.html#Un-Kell">Ün-Kell</a>'s zealotry. <a href="party.html#Zieg">Zieg</a> lights two of the beasts with faerie fire, making them easier targets for the party. <a href="party.html#Nassirra">Nassirra</a> jumps onto a nearby table and sends an arrow into one of the bugbears. <a href="party.html#Multimodal">Multimodal</a> sends a frigid ice knife into another. <a href="party.html#Rasputin">Rasputin</a>, unable to enter the field of spike growth without suffering harm himself, jumps from one stone table to the next. He lands a bit clumsily, suffering a nasty bruise, but is then able to send his fists into the nearest bugbears, killing one and harming the next. The second bugbear does not take kindly to the beating, and deals a mighty blow to <a href="party.html#Rasputin">Rasputin</a> in turn.</span></li>
        <li> <span class="combat"><a href="party.html#Un-Kell">Ün-Kell</a>, also unable to navigate the spike growth safely, hurls a javelin with all of his strength into the nearest bugbear, dealing the killing blow. <a href="party.html#Nassirra">Nassirra</a> then attacks the next bugbear in line with another arrow, and <a href="party.html#Multimodal">Multimodal</a> is able to land the killing blow using only a weak magical spell. <a href="party.html#Rasputin">Rasputin</a> jumps to another table to attack the last bugbear. But, he also offers the bugbear an opportunity to lay down its arms and surrender, in exchange for the possibility of surviving.</span></li>
    </ul> 
    <li> We clap the bugbear in irons and interrogate him.</li>
        <ul>
            <li> Upon being asked by <a href="party.html#Un-Kell">Ün-Kell</a> he tells us, incredulously, that his favorite color is red.</li>
            <li> More importantly, he confirms that he is not working alone, and that there are more of his allies in the caverns below. Some of them are bugbears, some are not. He tells us that his boss is a dark elf who summons strange creatures, including spiders. We infer that he may be speaking of the notorious <a href="npcs.html#The Spider">Spider</a> we first learned about from the Cragmaw goblins. He confirms that the elf does sometimes go by this name.</li>
            <ul>
                <li> He further tells us that <a href="npcs.html#The Spider">Spider</a> is capable of casting spells, bending the earth around him to his will, summoning unnatural creatures such as those that attacked Phandalin, and can use fiery magic as well.</li>
                <li> We ask him if he has seen a dwarf. He confirms that his group encountered two dwarves, killing one and kidnapping the other. We infer that <a href="npcs.html#Rockseeker">Nundro</a> is alive, and has been held captive by <a href="npcs.html#The Spider">Spider</a>.</li>
                <li> We ask whether there are traps we need to look out for. He says there are none in the mines, but that there are many traps elsewhere in the caverns. He also warns that he and his allies were not able to contend with whatever lurks in the lowest level of the spiral chamber.</li>
            </ul>
            <li> <a href="party.html#Rasputin">Rasputin</a> begins to tie a rope to the bugbear's manacles, to serve as a leash. We decide that he may be valuable as we navigate the cave. The bugbear, however, has other ideas. He refuses to be our "pet", and only wants to live if he can be set free. We can't take the risk of letting him escape, knowing that bugbears are not benevolent creatures. <span class="combat">Instead, we decide to execute the bugbear quickly and humanely. <a href="party.html#Un-Kell">Ün-Kell</a> grabs for his law blade, but he is unable to kill an unarmed bugbear after growing up around goblin folk. <a href="party.html#L">"L"</a>, <a href="party.html#Nassirra">Nassirra</a>, and <a href="party.html#Rasputin">Rasputin</a> instead deal the killing blows.</span></li>
            <li> We continue to explore the area. Two stone doors sit ajar, leading to the room the bugbears came from. Inside we find a kitchen with raw, partially rotten meat that the bugbears may have been preparing for a meal. The food in an adjoining pantry is all spoiled. We decide there is nothing more of value here, and move on. </li>
         </ul>
</ul>

<h3><span id="Level 3">Level 3</span></h3>
<ul>
    <li> We return to the spiral chamber and head to the southwest corner, where the waterfall is. We decide to explore the water. <a href="party.html#Zieg">Zieg</a> sets another copper piece alight and tosses it into the water. Nothing happens in response, suggesting that it may be safe. He is comfortable in water, as a Triton, and volunteers to explore. <a href="party.html#Multimodal">Multimodal</a> decides to go as well, and uses her druidic magic to assume the form of a giant crab. <a href="party.html#Un-Kell">Ün-Kell</a> holds on to a rope so that he can pull us up after we explore.
        <ul>
            <li> After diving into the water, <a href="party.html#Zieg">Zieg</a> notices something reflecting light at the bottom. He uncovers a mysterious bracelet partially buried in the sediment. He takes the bracelet for safekeeping.</li>
            <li> A current in the water pulls us toward the eastern wall, where there is some kind of channel. It is large enough for one of us to fit through. <a href="party.html#Zieg">Zieg</a> decides to explore, holding on to the rope just in case. The channel is rocky and dangerous, but he is able to follow it and discover another manmade room with a broken water wheel. He then returns to the waterfall.</li>
            <li> <a href="party.html#Multimodal">Multimodal</a> discovers another chute to the south, with very little current. It is much safer to navigate, she discovers. <a href="party.html#Zieg">Zieg</a> follows to see where the chute leads. It leads into a chamber that has natural walls carved by Ankhegs. They can easily wade out of the water and into a tunnel. After exploring the water's edge, <a href="party.html#Multimodal">Multimodal</a> and <a href="party.html#Zieg">Zieg</a> return to the main waterfall chamber where <a href="party.html#Zieg">Zieg</a> reports their findings to the group. We decide that the rest of the party should come down, and we can use one of the three potential exit points to launch a surprise attack on whatever lurks in the adjoining rooms. </li>
            <li> <a href="party.html#Rasputin">Rasputin</a> manages to jump down without incident. <a href="party.html#L">"L"</a> gets caught in the current after jumping down, and <a href="party.html#Multimodal">Multimodal</a> uses one of her giant crab claws to stop him from being swept away in the current. It is painful, but it works. </li>
            <li> <a href="party.html#Rasputin">Rasputin</a> and <a href="party.html#L">"L"</a> climb a ledge to the north which connects to the bottom of the spiral chamber. They can feel intense burning as they breathe near the chamber. <a href="party.html#L">"L"</a> sends <a href="party.html#L">Bob</a> to scout. <a href="party.html#L">Bob</a>'s eyes burn in the thick, green-tinged air. He sees a statue of some kind of Dwarf warrior facing the eastern side of the room, and fungus everywhere.</li>
            <li> <a href="party.html#Nassirra">Nassirra</a> jumps down and struggles in the water. <a href="party.html#Multimodal">Multimodal</a> reaches a claw out and grasps one of her vines, keeping her from getting caught in the current. As <a href="party.html#Nassirra">Nassirra</a> struggles to get to the ledge, she again is swept into the water, and <a href="party.html#Multimodal">Multimodal</a> grabs her with a claw again, this time causing some damage. She is able to climb onto the ledge. <a href="party.html#Un-Kell">Ün-Kell</a> jumps down, making a huge splash in the water. </li>
            <li> As our party members gather outside the spiral room, <a href="party.html#Rasputin">Rasputin</a> enters. He unwittingly disturbs some of the fungus, which launches spores into his face. The spores are painful, and cause temporary blindness.</li>
            <li> Upon seeing what has happened to <a href="party.html#Rasputin">Rasputin</a>, we decide to avoid the spiral chamber for now. Instead, we opt to take the southern channel, where the current was not as strong. <a href="party.html#Zieg">Zieg</a> helps ferry the party across the water while <a href="party.html#Multimodal">Multimodal</a> uses her giant crab form to block off the eastern channel, where the current is strongest. This prevents <a href="party.html#L">"L"</a> and <a href="party.html#Rasputin">Rasputin</a> from being sucked into the current as they struggle to swim across the water.</li>
    </ul>
    <li> Eventually, the party makes it through the southern channel and emerges in the tunnel southeast of the waterfall. <a href="party.html#Multimodal">Multimodal</a> returns to her Firbolg form. The party explores further and discovers an Ankheg tunnel heading south, but a wooden blockade to the north.</li>
    <li> We decide to break down the blockade. <a href="party.html#Un-Kell">Ün-Kell</a> slams into it, allowing us passage through to the room on the other side. There are two ruin structures in the room that appear to be water wheels of some kind, and there is something amiss about the situation.</li>
    <ul>
        <li> Immediately, <a href="party.html#Un-Kell">Ün-Kell</a> and <a href="party.html#Rasputin">Rasputin</a> can hear ominous scratching sounds coming from somewhere in side the room, and the smell of sulfur and soot waft into their noses. As we enter the room, we see that there are some strange creatures, similar to spiders or crabs in form, but with jeweled eyes. They are elemental in form, with glowing crystals for eyes.</li>
        </span><li> <span id="11/11/2018"> <span class="combat"><a href="party.html#Nassirra">Nassirra</a> and <a href="party.html#L">"L"</a> attack the strange crab that is nearest the party, in the southern part of the room. <a href="party.html#Rasputin">Rasputin</a> drinks a potion to recover his strength from the wounds he suffered in previous battles and his struggle down the waterfall. </span></span>
        <li> <span class="combat">The second creature, furthest from the party, launches an attack against the group. <a href="party.html#Rasputin">Rasputin</a> and <a href="party.html#Nassirra">Nassirra</a> fall unconscious as a result. <span class="special"><a href="party.html#Multimodal">Multimodal</a> heals both of them and is bestowed with the title "<a href="party.html#Multimodal">Multimodal</a> the Lifeweaver".</span></span> </li>
        <li> <span class="combat"><a href="party.html#Un-Kell">Ün-Kell</a> strikes the closest foe with his lawblade and kills it, leaving but a pile of earth and the two glowing crystal eyes. <a href="party.html#L">"L"</a> uses his knowledge of the arcane arts to determine that the creatures are glowmites, rock elementals with regenerative powers. He shares this information with the rest of the party. In response, <a href="party.html#Nassirra">Nassirra</a> attempts to smash the glowing eye crystals on the ground, which causes the glow to dim.</span> </li>
        <li> <span class="combat"><a href="party.html#Zieg">Zieg</a> sends a guiding bolt toward the remaining glowmite, but the spell does not harm it. <a href="party.html#L">"L"</a> launches an Eldritch Blast at the creature that is similarly ineffective. In response, it attacks <a href="party.html#Zieg">Zieg</a> and <a href="party.html#Un-Kell">Ün-Kell</a>, causing modest damage to them. <a href="party.html#Multimodal">Multimodal</a> weakens the creature with faerie fire. <a href="party.html#Un-Kell">Ün-Kell</a> and <a href="party.html#L">"L"</a> manage to reduce the creature to rubble. </span></li>
        <li> <a href="party.html#Rasputin">Rasputin</a> takes one of the glowmite eyes from the carcass, despite objections from members of the party.</li>
        <li> Further inspection of the now-safe room reveals that the water wheel was part of some type of forging apparatus, suggesting that the forge <a href="npcs.html#Rockseeker">Gundren</a> and his brothers sought is near.</li>
        <li> The party turns their attention toward the northern part of the room, where two ornate doors stand. They are coered in glowing runes that are almost like Dwarven runes. There are symbols depicting an eye, a hammer, mountains, and fire. <a href="party.html#Rasputin">Rasputin</a> and <a href="party.html#Zieg">Zieg</a> use their Dwarven and religious knowledge, respectively, to determine that the symbols relate to the Dwarven creation myth. The creator of the Dwarves, Morvain, was said to have discovered the earth, heated it with flame, and forged the Dwarves from it with a hammer. <a href="party.html#Rasputin">Rasputin</a> touches the symbols in the sequence that corresponds to the myth: the eye for Morvain, the mountains for earth, fire, and then the hammer. The door then opens.</li>
    </ul>
    <li> On the other side of the door, the party finds a large chamber with an obelisk and a dais with an altar, and an eerie lit brazier of green flame. Two unlit, smaller braziers sit in the far corners of the room. Two green, round, similarly eerie objects reveal themselves to be eye stalks, and speak to the party. They mistake the party for workers, who are forbidden from the chamber, and ask the party to return to work. </li>
    <li> Straight across from the opened, ornate door is a hole in the wall that is actively being dug out by a bugbear. The bugbear spots the party, and warns someone that he calls "boss". The party heeds the eye stalks' request for us to leave by proceeding through the hole in the wall to a new chamber, which once was a library, where we discover an elf of some kind accompanied by blighted spiders and bugbears. Two dwarves, unidentifiable at our range, sit in the far corner of the room near the elf.</li>
    <ul>
        <li> The elf acknowledges that he is the figure we have known only as "<a href="npcs.html#The Spider">The Spider</a>". He further states that we have caused a great deal of trouble for him, but he tries to be friends with us. He offers to reunite us with <a href="npcs.html#Rockseeker">Nundro</a>, <a href="npcs.html#Rockseeker">Gundren</a>'s missing brother. Further investigation reveals that this "<a href="npcs.html#Rockseeker">Nundro</a>" is actually a doppleganer, aligned with <a href="npcs.html#The Spider">The Spider</a>, disguised as <a href="npcs.html#Rockseeker">Nundro</a>. </li>
        <ul>
            <li> The elf pleads with us to hear him out, and for some reason, we do. Kind of. His real name is Na'Zandar, and he is from the <a href="lore.html#The Feywild">Feywild</a> elves who once dwelled in the land now known as Phandalin, which was stolen by humans. He seeks vengeance and wants to use the spellforge to arm his troops. He asks us to join his cause, seeing that none of us are humans, and assumes we will be sympathetic. He had not even made it to the spell forge, the chamber adjacent to this room, before we arrived.</li>
            <li> We make it clear that we can't trust him, he tried to kill us multiple times already, and that we cannot abide his blood for blood mentality. </li>
        </ul>
        <li> <span class="combat"><a href="party.html#Zieg">Zieg</a> decides he has heard enough, and communes with Pelor to ignite his enemies with radiant flame. Na'Zandar responds by heating the metal of <a href="party.html#Zieg">Zieg</a>'s armor, then assuming the form of a spider and climbing to the ceiling.</span></li>
        <ul>
            <li> <span class="combat"><a href="party.html#L">"L"</a> and <a href="party.html#Rasputin">Rasputin</a> turn their attention to the doppleganger near them. <a href="party.html#Nassirra">Nassirra</a> nimbly climbs atop a bookcase and takes aim with her bow. Ultimately, <a href="party.html#L">"L"</a>, <a href="party.html#Nassirra">Nassirra</a>, and <a href="party.html#Rasputin">Rasputin</a> manage to slay it, though <a href="party.html#Rasputin">Rasputin</a> suffers heavy blows in the fight. <a href="party.html#Multimodal">Multimodal</a> heals him.</span></li>
            <li> <span class="combat"><a href="party.html#Multimodal">Multimodal</a> summons a flame-wreathed magical blade and attacks a bugbear in the southern part of the room with it.

            <li> <span class="combat"><a href="party.html#Zieg">Zieg</a> weakens Na'Zandar and his surrounding minions with faerie fire. <a href="party.html#Un-Kell">Ün-Kell</a> and <a href="party.html#Nassirra">Nassirra</a> proceed to slay the bugbear flanking Na'Zandar. <a href="party.html#Nassirra">Nassirra</a> does an impressive backflip onto an adjacent bookshelf. <a href="party.html#Un-Kell">Ün-Kell</a> turns his attention to Na'Zandar, climbing onto a workbench to reach his arachnid form on the ceiling. <a href="party.html#Zieg">Zieg</a>'s scalding hot armor periodically wounds him, but by the grace of Pelor he bears the pain and managed to hurl a magical guiding bolt at Na'Zandar, which knocks him out of his arachnid form and onto the floor.</span></li>
            <li> <span class="combat"><a href="party.html#L">"L"</a> nearly single-handedly destroys the blighted spider in the southern corner of the room, leaving only the weakened form of Na'Zandar and one last blighted spider in the northern corner of the room. </span></li>
            <li> <span class="combat"><a href="party.html#Rasputin">Rasputin</a> strikes Na'Zandar, and he appears to vanish in response. <a href="party.html#Nassirra">Nassirra</a> uses her keen ability to track her targets and determines that he has not disappeared, but has shapeshifted into a tiny spider. She yells this information to the rest of the party so that we know to search for him. <a href="party.html#Multimodal">Multimodal</a> shapeshifts into a spider and climbs on the ceiling, then uses her spider senses to try and locate other spiders that may be on the same web. She only detects the large blight spider that remains, which <a href="party.html#L">"L"</a> proceeds to kill with an Eldritch Blast.</span> </li>
            <li> <span class="combat"><a href="party.html#Zieg">Zieg</a> locates the tiny form of Na'Zandar and smashes it with his spectral mace, once again forcing Na'Zandar back into his elf form. The party gathers around Na'Zandar, intimidating him, and ordering him to surrender. <a href="party.html#Rasputin">Rasputin</a> punches him in the face, and knocks him out. We take the opportunity to liberate him from the magical objects that aid him, including his spell-casting focus (a wooden staff) and a magical cloak. <a href="party.html#Multimodal">Multimodal</a>, still in spider form, wraps his body tightly in webs to restrain him. </span></li>
            <ul>
                    <li> <a href="party.html#Multimodal">Multimodal</a> decides she can make use of his magical staff (<i><a href="party.html#Multimodal">The Elder Branch</a></i>) as her druidic focus. <a href="party.html#Un-Kell">Ün-Kell</a> decides to don the cloak (<i><a href="party.html#Un-Kell">Cloak of Arachnids</a></i>), which can harm melee attackers.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>  We find that <a href="npcs.html#Rockseeker">Nundro</a> is still alive, though he does not look well. <a href="party.html#Zieg">Zieg</a> administers a healing potion to him, which revives him. We tell him who we are, and that his brother <a href="npcs.html#Rockseeker">Gundren</a> is alive and well. He says he does not know why he was kept alive.</li>
            <li> Now that the room is safe, we take the opportunity to explore it. <a href="party.html#L">"L"</a> finds some magical tomes and studies them, though many of them are theoretical in nature, not tomes of spells and other practical magics. </li>
            <li>The party discovers a <a href="lore.html#Cryptic Map">cryptic map</a> of the continent, surrounded by six objects. Question marks surrounding the objects and arrows appear to indicate where the map maker believed those objects might be, though there is clearly high uncertainty over the objects' locations. </li>
            <li>A shaft that may contain something like a dumbwaiter is located in the northwest corner of the room.</li>
        </ul>
    </ul>
    <li> We decide to barricade ourselves in the library using the bookshelves in order to recuperate from battle and tend to our various wounds. <a href="party.html#Nassirra">Nassirra</a> protects the party with an alarm spell to warn us of any danger that might come upon us in our sleep. 
        <ul>
            </span><li> <span id="12/02/2018"> As we beging to settle down, we discuss how we want to deal with the villanous Na'Zandar. <a href="party.html#Zieg">Zieg</a> and <a href="party.html#Multimodal">Multimodal</a> make it clear that they want <a href="npcs.html#The Spider">the Spider</a> to pay for his crimes with his life. <a href="party.html#L">"L"</a> suspects that he may yet be of value to the party, and wishes to keep him alive. <a href="party.html#Multimodal">Multimodal</a> cautions that if he wakes, he will be able to assume the form of a beast again and bypass his restraints, which would potentially allow him to escape. <a href="party.html#L">"L"</a> plans to make Na'Zandar comply by magical means in order to gain information. </li>
            <li> The party designates watches to make sure nothing nefarious occurs during the rest period. <a href="party.html#Un-Kell">Ün-Kell</a> and <a href="party.html#L">"L"</a> take the first watch, <a href="party.html#Rasputin">Rasputin</a> and <a href="party.html#Zieg">Zieg</a> the second, and <a href="party.html#Nassirra">Nassirra</a> and <a href="party.html#Multimodal">Multimodal</a> the final watch.</li>
            <ul>
                <li> The first watch is strangely eventful. </li>
                <ul>
                    <li> First, the glowmite crystal that <a href="party.html#Rasputin">Rasputin</a> kept in his pocket began to regenerate a glowmite, <span class="combat">ripping out from <a href="party.html#Rasputin">Rasputin</a>'s pocket. <a href="party.html#Rasputin">Rasputin</a> kills the glowmite and returns the crystal to his pouch. Some time later, the glowmite begins to regenerate again, bursting from the pouch. This time, <a href="party.html#Rasputin">Rasputin</a> beats the crystal with a hammer until the soft glow that had emanated from it is extinguished. </span></li>
                    <li> Second, <a href="party.html#L">"L"</a> and <a href="party.html#Un-Kell">Ün-Kell</a> notice Na'Zandar wake. <a href="party.html#L">"L"</a> tries to use dark magic to force Na'Zandar to give us information, but his attempts fail. Instead, he and <a href="party.html#Un-Kell">Ün-Kell</a> intimidate <a href="npcs.html#The Spider">the Spider</a> into revealing information, but all he is able to tell us is that the spell forge is powered by fey magic. <span class="combat"><a href="party.html#L">"L"</a> decides that Na'Zandar is no longer of use to us. <a href="party.html#Un-Kell">Ün-Kell</a> slams his shield against him and knocks him unconscious again.</span></li>
                </ul>
                <li> The second watch was also very eventful.</li>
                <ul>
                    <li> At the beginning of the second watch, <a href="party.html#L">"L"</a> and <a href="party.html#Un-Kell">Ün-Kell</a> convey their thoughts to <a href="party.html#Zieg">Zieg</a> and <a href="party.html#Rasputin">Rasputin</a>. </li>
                    <li> <span class="combat"><a href="party.html#Rasputin">Rasputin</a> agrees that Na'Zandar must die, and decides to carry out the act himself. After <a href="party.html#Zieg">Zieg</a> performs last rites, <a href="party.html#Rasputin">Rasputin</a> takes a hand axe and slits Na'Zandar's throat, then watches him bleed to death.</span></li>
                    <li> <span class="special">Suddenly, <a href="party.html#Rasputin">Rasputin</a> begins to feel blood running down his own chest, but he has no bleeding wound. His tattoo begins to change; he is transformed as he enters the Maw of the Demon Lord. <a href="party.html#Zieg">Zieg</a>'s vision turns to darkness mysteriously. He is filled with a sense of dread. He examines <a href="party.html#Rasputin">Rasputin</a>'s tattoo and recognizes it to be a symbol of great evil. He fears for his companion, and encourages <a href="party.html#Rasputin">Rasputin</a> to be cautious.</span></li>
                </ul>
                <li> At the beginning of the third watch, <a href="party.html#Zieg">Zieg</a> conveys his concern about <a href="party.html#Rasputin">Rasputin</a> to <a href="party.html#Multimodal">Multimodal</a>, who too seems concerned. Rastpuin assures them both that he is simply becoming closer to death, but that he is open to help from his companions to maintain balance between life and death.</li>
                <ul>
                    <li> <span class="special"><a href="party.html#Nassirra">Nassirra</a> reaches a new level of control over her vines after rehashing the events of the previous combat. She is able to manipulate them such that she can reach a target within 20 feet at will. </span></li>
                </ul>
            </ul>
            <li> After resting the party feels rejuvenated, though <a href="npcs.html#Rockseeker">Nundro</a> is still a bit worse for wear. He sees what has befallen <a href="npcs.html#The Spider">the Spider</a> and expresses relief. </li>
    </ul>
</ul>
<h3><span id="After Na'Zandar">After Na'Zandar</a></h3>
<ul>
    <li> <a href="party.html#Nassirra">Nassirra</a> resumes exploring by investigating the dumbwaiter more closely. She enters the dumbwaiter and, with <a href="party.html#Un-Kell">Ün-Kell</a>'s assistance, ascends to the upper levels of the mine. She recognized the second level to be the same halls in which the group encountered a deadly gelatinous cube. She continues on to the first level, where she finds more stoneworked halls that the party had not yet explored.</li>
    <ul>
        <li> She hears a strange sound, like raw meat slapping, and a groan. She exits the dumbwaiter to investigate, until her instincts tell her that the danger is too great for her to take on alone. She returns to the dumbwaiter and calls out to <a href="party.html#Un-Kell">Ün-Kell</a> to bring her back down. <span class="combat">Her yell attracts the attention of what was once a Dwarf miner, but now is a rotting undead monstrosity. <a href="party.html#Un-Kell">Ün-Kell</a> pulls the chains to lower the dumbwaiter, but not before the zombie jumps on top of it.</span> <a href="party.html#Nassirra">Nassirra</a> exits the dumbwaiter on the third level and tells the party what she found.</li>
        <li> <a href="party.html#Zieg">Zieg</a> and <a href="party.html#Rasputin">Rasputin</a> decide to put down the creature. <a href="party.html#Zieg">Zieg</a> wards of evil by blessing himself and <a href="party.html#Rasputin">Rasputin</a>. <span class="combat">As the dumbwaiter ascends, the zombie's toes get clipped off and thick, syrupy brown liquid pours out of the wounds. When it reaches the first level of the cave, the dumbwaiter crushes the zombie between the cavern ceiling and the dumbwaiter. <a href="party.html#Rasputin">Rasputin</a> strikes the still-wriggling zombie in the eye, killing it once and for all.</span></li>
        <li> <a href="party.html#Zieg">Zieg</a> and <a href="party.html#Rasputin">Rasputin</a> reveal a long stoneworked hallway, and turn left at the end to continue down another hall with three doors. <a href="party.html#Rasputin">Rasputin</a> attempts to open the first door, but it does not budge. <a href="party.html#Zieg">Zieg</a> spots skeletal remains and a blood stain on the floor near another door that is ajar. <span class="combat">He catches a glimpse inside the door and discovers that there are more zombies inside to contend with. <a href="party.html#Rasputin">Rasputin</a> joins him, rushing into the room and striking one of the zombies. In doing so, he discovers that the room is full of the undead.</span> </li>
        <li> Around this time, the rest of the party grows concerned and decides to go upstairs and help. <a href="party.html#L">"L"</a>, <a href="party.html#Nassirra">Nassirra</a>, and <a href="party.html#Multimodal">Multimodal</a> pile into the dumbwaiter after <a href="party.html#Un-Kell">Ün-Kell</a> summons it back down to the third level of the cave. It takes some time, but he manages to hoist the group back up.</li>
        <li> <span class="combat">While the rest of the party ascends in the dumbwaiter, <a href="party.html#Rasputin">Rasputin</a> manages to kill one of the zombies. <a href="party.html#Zieg">Zieg</a> then ignites the entire room with a mighty fireball, decimating all but two of the monsters, which <a href="party.html#Rasputin">Rasputin</a> is then easily able to kill with his fists.</span></li>
        <li> The gang regroups and then continues to explore the halls. <a href="party.html#Un-Kell">Ün-Kell</a> goes back to the first door that <a href="party.html#Rasputin">Rasputin</a> could not open. Despite his strength, he too is unable to open the door, though the force of his strength cracks the door. <a href="party.html#Nassirra">Nassirra</a> explores the next room along the same side of the hall and discovers a room that is empty save for a few old, deteriorating beds. There is a door on the right side of the room that leads to the room <a href="party.html#Rasputin">Rasputin</a> and <a href="party.html#Un-Kell">Ün-Kell</a> attempted to enter earlier. <a href="party.html#Nassirra">Nassirra</a> explores the room and smells something strange that is both acrid and sweet. </li>
        <ul>
            <li> She discovers a humanoid creature hiding behind a bed that looks somehow fungal in nature. <a href="party.html#Un-Kell">Ün-Kell</a> joins her, followed by <a href="party.html#Multimodal">Multimodal</a>. It does not appear to be hostile.</li>
            <li> <a href="party.html#Multimodal">Multimodal</a> tries to identify the creature with no success. She asks whether it is friend or foe, but cannot understand the creature's response. She calls out to the rest of the paryt, and <a href="party.html#L">"L"</a> joins the group's investigation.</li>
            <li> <a href="party.html#Un-Kell">Ün-Kell</a> tries to offer it some jerky from his rations, but it is not enticed. </li>
            <li> <a href="party.html#Multimodal">Multimodal</a> tries to comfort it, and offers a pineapple to the creature. It warily approaches the pineapple and begins eating the leaves. <a href="party.html#Multimodal">Multimodal</a> decides to name it Spike II.</li>
            <li> The creature releases a cloud of rapport spores that land on <a href="party.html#L">"L"</a>, <a href="party.html#Nassirra">Nassirra</a>, <a href="party.html#Multimodal">Multimodal</a>, and <a href="party.html#Un-Kell">Ün-Kell</a>. The spores allow them to communicate with the sporeling and feel its emotions. It reveals that it is lost and needs help finding its family. <a href="party.html#Un-Kell">Ün-Kell</a>, <a href="party.html#Nassirra">Nassirra</a>, and <a href="party.html#Multimodal">Multimodal</a> decide to help it. <a href="party.html#L">"L"</a> decides to rejoin <a href="party.html#Rasputin">Rasputin</a> and <a href="party.html#Zieg">Zieg</a> to explore elsewhere. <a href="party.html#L">"L"</a> sends <a href="party.html#L">Bob</a> with the escort team to keep watch, and <a href="npcs.html#Rockseeker">Nundro</a> joins the escort efforts as well. The party decides to reconvene in Helm's Deep after their respective missions are complete.</li>
            <li> The sporeling creature leads us back to the large spiral chamber, and directs us to a stoneworked hall on the other side of the spiral. They easily cross, and upon entering the hallway they discover a reception area with another sporeling that is mouthing an old tome. It senses the spores on the adventurers and greets us warmly. Then, when Spike II enters the room, the two sporelings rejoice. Spike II thanks us and welcomes us to visit any time. </li>
            <li> We decide to explore the rest of the sporeling's commune. First we find a large room with bookshelves and a group of sporelings enjoying the books, chewing on them. There are a series of small offices occupied by sporelings, all of whom cheerily greet us as we explore. Finally, we find a large office that is unoccupied. In the corner there is a large desk. <a href="party.html#Nassirra">Nassirra</a> examines the desk and finds a locked drawer, which she picks deftly with her thieves tools.</li>
            <ul>
                <li> Inside the desk she finds a deteroriating old document, which she realizes is the deed for Wave Echo Cave. It names an entity with whom the party is not familiar as proprieter of the mine. She also finds a small box containing gold pieces, which she distributes among the three of them.</li>
            </ul> 
            <li> <a href="party.html#Multimodal">Multimodal</a>, <a href="party.html#Nassirra">Nassirra</a>, and <a href="party.html#Un-Kell">Ün-Kell</a> bid the sporelings farewell and return to Helm's Deep. They find <a href="npcs.html#Rockseeker">Gundren</a> there, and witness a heartwarming reunion between the <a ref="nps.html#Rockseeker">Rockseeker</a> brothers. </li>
            <ul>
                <li> <a href="party.html#Nassirra">Nassirra</a> tells <a href="npcs.html#Rockseeker">Gundren</a> that we found something he will be interested in, and <a href="party.html#Multimodal">Multimodal</a> presents the deed to the mine. <a href="npcs.html#Rockseeker">Gundren</a> is thrilled, and decides that his brother <a href="npcs.html#Rockseeker">Tharden</a> did not die in vain. </li>

They come face to face with the eye-stalk creatures who guard the forge. They again mistake the adventurers for workers and tell them to leave. <a href="party.html#L">"L"</a> deceives them into believing that they are indeed workers, and that they were sent by the Master to enter the guarded room on his behalf.

    <li> <a href="party.html#Nassirra">Nassirra</a> and <a href="party.html#Multimodal">Multimodal</a> stay at the townmaster's hall. </li>
    <ul>
        <li> <a href="party.html#Multimodal">Multimodal</a> asks <a href="npcs.html#Sildar">Sildar</a> to train her in his defensive style of fighting, so that she can protect those she cares about. He agrees to train her, but warns that it will take time to master the techniques.</li>
        <li> While <a href="npcs.html#Sildar">Sildar</a> is distracted, <a href="party.html#Nassirra">Nassirra</a> cases the joint. She notes several vulnerabilities that she can exploit in the future.</li>
        <li> After <a href="npcs.html#Sildar">Sildar</a> says goodbye, both <a href="party.html#Nassirra">Nassirra</a> and <a href="party.html#Multimodal">Multimodal</a> head to the inn.</li>
    </ul>
    <li> The party regroups at the Stone Hill Inn. Toblin welcomes us and thanks us for our help during the blight attack. As a token of his gratitude, he offers us free lodging, food, and drink. </li>
    <ul>
        <li> We find <a href="npcs.html#Rockseeker">Gundren</a> and <a href="npcs.html#Rockseeker">Nundro</a> already drinking quite a lot. <a href="party.html#Zieg">Zieg</a> toasts them, and we pour one out in honor of <a href="npcs.html#Rockseeker">Tharden</a>, who is no longer with us. </li>
            <ul>
                <li> To thank us for our help, <a href="npcs.html#Rockseeker">Gundren</a> and <a href="npcs.html#Rockseeker">Nundro</a> say that when they get the mining operation started, they will give us a cut of the profits. They are optimistic about the mine's future. </li>
                <li> <a href="party.html#Zieg">Zieg</a> asks them if they know anything about Old Owl Well, but they don't have any information and are very inebriated. Toblin overhears and shares what he can.</li>
                <ul>
                    <li> He tells us that Old Owl Well is located off the road between Phandalin and Triboar, closer to Triboar. It has fresh water in the well, and there is an abandoned tower nearby. He warns that orcs may attack us on the way, and urges us to be careful.</li>
                </ul>
            </ul> 
        <li> <a href="npcs.html#Sildar">Sildar</a> comes to the inn to train <a href="party.html#Multimodal">Multimodal</a>. She gets frustrated because hand to hand combat is strange to her, but she powers through and learns some skills.</li>
    </ul>
    <li> We rest in the inn for the night. </li>
    <li> In the morning, we stop at Barthen's to get some supplies, but he doesn't have much to offer. <a href="party.html#Zieg">Zieg</a> buys a holy water flask and some other reagents. He makes holy water and distributes it to his companions. <a href="party.html#Rasputin">Rasputin</a> buys flasks of oil and a tinderbox. </li>
</ul>
<h2><span id="Old Owl Well">Old Owl Well</span></h2>
<ul>
    <li> We head east on the Triboar Trail looking for Old Owl Well. After a hard day's journey, we make camp and rest. <a href="party.html#Rasputin">Rasputin</a> feels the need to end life, and decides to kill a wild boar. The boar becomes food for the group. </li>
    <li>The next day, we come across a signpost. The sign points west to <i>Phandalin</i>, south to <i>Hakaar</i>, and east to <i>Triboar</i>.</li>
    <li> <a href="party.html#Nassirra">Nassirra</a> notices a clearing off the road. She tells the group about it, and <a href="party.html#L">"L"</a> sends <a href="party.html#L">Bob</a> to scout. </li>
    <ul>
        <li> <a href="party.html#L">Bob</a> conveys an image to <a href="party.html#L">"L"</a> showing a hill and several humanoid figures. <a href="party.html#L">"L"</a> suspects that they are zombies.</li>
    </ul>
    <li> <span class="combat"><a href="party.html#Rasputin">Rasputin</a> rushes in. A mob of six zombies approaches him. They exude a dark aura.</span></li>
    <ul>
        <li> <span class="combat">Under the protection of pass without trace, the rest of the party stays hidden and strategizes from a distance.</span> </li>
        <ul>
            <li> <span class="combat">The rest of the party carefully approaches. From a safe distance, <a href="party.html#Multimodal">Multimodal</a> summons a storm cloud and calls lightning down on the zombies. As the lightning hits, a necrotic force emanates from them, harming <a href="party.html#Rasputin">Rasputin</a>.</span> </li>
        </ul>
        <li> <span class="combat">asputin throws a vial of holy water at one of the zombies and punches it. He then runs to a nearby graveyard, and all but one of the zombies pursue him. </span></li>
        <li> <span class="combat"><a href="party.html#Zieg">Zieg</a> empowers <a href="party.html#Un-Kell">Ün-Kell</a> with a resistance spell and sets his mace, Dawnbringer, alight. The nearest zombie sees this and approaches him. <a href="party.html#Nassirra">Nassirra</a> climbs a nearby tree to sharpshoot. She kills one zombie and hurts another. </span></li>
        <li>
            <span class="combat"> <a href="party.html#L">"L"</a> and <a href="party.html#Multimodal">Multimodal</a> send a barrage of spells at the nearest zombie: <a href="party.html#L">"L"</a> casts Eldritch blast and seriously wounds it, then <a href="party.html#Multimodal">Multimodal</a> calls another bolt of lightning down on it. <a href="party.html#Zieg">Zieg</a> deals the finishing blow with a radiant attack.</span> </li>
        <li> <span class="combat"><a href="party.html#Rasputin">Rasputin</a> continues to fight off the zombies that surround him. He runs further into the woods and they follow. <a href="party.html#Un-Kell">Ün-Kell</a> enters a rage, and throws a javelin at the zombie nearest to him. <a href="party.html#Nassirra">Nassirra</a> then deals it the killing blow. We manage to kill all of them without losing <a href="party.html#Rasputin">Rasputin</a>.</span> </li>
    </ul>
    <li> With the undead threat extinguished, we examine the rest of the grounds. </li>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <a href="party.html#Zieg">Zieg</a> explores a nearby tent. It contains a fine wooden desk and a series of strange vials. A dead human male lies on the floor, clearly a victim of the zombies' hunger. He bears tattoos and wears a red robe with black markings. Clasped in his hands is a <a href="lore.html#Journal">journal</a>. </li>
        <ul>
            <li> <a href="party.html#Zieg">Zieg</a> takes the <a href="lore.html#Journal">journal</a> and peruses it. He discovers that the man's name is Hamun Kost, and he was a necromancer. He had used dark wood, like the runed splinters we found after Phandalin was attacked, to imbue his creations with a necrotic aura. The <a href="lore.html#Journal">journal</a> mentions the town of Lucav, which is on the northeast side of the continent. It also mentions a fishing village to the south that <a href="party.html#Zieg">Zieg</a> likely knows, but does not give a name. Finally, it mentions rumors of a ruined town called Thundertree, which Hamun learned of in Westport (and so it might be nearby). </li>
            <li> <a href="party.html#Zieg">Zieg</a> searches the desk. He finds a potion of greater healing along with some strange vials. We decide to burn the tent in a controlled manner so that nobody else can commit the atrocities that Hamun carried out here. </li>
            <li> <a href="party.html#Zieg">Zieg</a> investigates the well, which appears to be normal and has clear water. We examine the nearby ruined tower and find little left of it at all. The floor has rotted away and its walls have fallen down. </li>
        </ul>
        <li> <a href="party.html#Multimodal">Multimodal</a> and <a href="party.html#Zieg">Zieg</a> use their spirtual connections to intuit whether these zombies and those that we found at Wave Echo Cave are similar. We determine that the creatures here were zombies, deceased humans who were reanimated, and those in Wave Echo Cave were ghouls, creatures sent from hell that had never lived previously. We consider going to the temples in Elspire to learn more.</li>
    </ul>
</ul>

<h2><span id="Arrival in Triboar">Arrival in Triboar</span></h2>
<ul>
    <li> We follow the Triboar Trail east until we find the town, comprised of three hills surrounded by a fence.</li>
    <li> We are approached by a figure on horseback. The man introduces himself as Sir Grimleaf. He asks what our business is in Triboar. <a href="party.html#Zieg">Zieg</a> tells him that we were sent by <a href="npcs.html#Razak">Razak</a>. Sir Grimleaf recognizes the name and is very impressed. He tells us that Triboar is a dangerous place, frequently under orc attack, and that we can inquire with Captain Vilandris at Whitewood Palace if we want to help.</li>
    <li> We enter the town and find a tavern called The Cornered Cat. There are roads that branch out from the town center and reach each of the three hills. The palace is located on the southern hill. </li>
    <li> Before going to the palace, we decide to visit The Cornered Cat for some lunch and gossip about the town. Immediately, we notice that the floor is sticky and the tavern smells. </li>
    <ul>
        <li> We get a table and meet our Tabaxi server. A group of patrons prepares to leave the bar, and dumps the rest of their ale out on the floor and table before exiting. Looking around, we notice several other patrons: a halfling at the bar and a group of Scarlet Vigil members. </li> 
        <li> <a href="party.html#Nassirra">Nassirra</a> talks to the halfling and learns that the dumping of leftover ale is a custom at the tavern. </li>
        <li> <a href="party.html#Zieg">Zieg</a> approaches the Scarlet Vigil members and buys them two rounds of ale in exchange for information. He learns that orcs have been attacking from the Fetid Tangle to the south. They make snide comments about the place and joke about burning it to the ground. They say their elven captain, Vilandris, is making a mistake by ordering them to stay in Triboar, and that they should really take the fight to the orcs themselves.</li>
    </ul>
    <li> <a href="party.html#Zieg">Zieg</a> returns to the party and shares this information with us. We decide to go to Whitewood Palace and talk to Captain Vilandris ourselves. </li>
    <ul>
        <li> When we arrive, <a href="party.html#Zieg">Zieg</a> tells a guard that we were sent by Sir Grimleaf to speak with Captain Vilandris. The guard escorts us to the captain. </li>
        <li> We decide that <a href="party.html#L">"L"</a> should lead the discussion, and we enter what appears to be the captain's office. </li>
        <ul>
            </span><li> <span id="05/18/2019"> <a href="party.html#L">"L"</a> greets Vilandris, but is taken aback when he realizes that Vilandris is an elf. He nervously palms his dagger as he asks Vilandris about the orc attacks on Triboar and the nearby towns.</li>
            <li>
                <a href="party.html#L">"L"</a>'s back begins to ache, and he loses self-control. He grabs his dagger. <a href="party.html#Zieg">Zieg</a> grabs his hand to prevent him from attacking the elf. <a href="party.html#Multimodal">Multimodal</a> interjects to provide the cover story that <a href="party.html#L">"L"</a> is champing at the bit for an opportunity to kill more orcs. <a href="party.html#Rasputin">Rasputin</a> pulls out his string of orc ears, entirely unsolicited, as proof of our prior encounter with orcs. <a href="party.html#L">"L"</a> regains his composure.</li>
            <li> Vilandris tells us that they sent scouts into the Fetid Tangle to investigate and are awaiting the return of one scout, Miranda. They warn that Elk's Crossing, a town that lies due east from Triboar under <a href="npcs.html#Razak">Razak</a>'s charge, has been under attack. In passing, Vilandris mentions something about a town healer.</li>
        </ul>
    </ul>
     <li> A well-dressed older woman enters the room. Her name is Ermina, and we realize that she is the mayor of Triboar. She seems scared. </li>
     <li> Two horns sound in the distance. Vilandris says the signal indicates the return of a scout. We acommpany Vilandris to the gate. </li>
     <ul>
         <li> The scout, Miranda, has a large crossbow bolt protrudcing from her shoulder. Vilandris pulls the bolt out and <a href="party.html#Zieg">Zieg</a> heals the gaping wound. </li>
         <li> She tells us that Elk's Crossing is under threat, and soon Triboar will be as well. Orcs approach from the north and east, and goblins from the south. The orcs are uncharacteristically organized and have harnessed powerful magics that they did not possess before, including something like telekinesis.</li>
         <li> We can tell Vilandris is hiding something. <a href="party.html#Multimodal">Multimodal</a> directly asks him what he is hiding, explaining that we need to know everything so we can protect the town. Vilandris says the orcs have been kidnapping humans only, and killing non-humans that they encounter.</li>
         <ul>
             <li>
                <a href="party.html#Multimodal">Multimodal</a> and <a href="party.html#Zieg">Zieg</a> meditate on why humans would be a target. <a href="party.html#Multimodal">Multimodal</a> receives the divine insight that humans are uniquely capable of cross-breeding with other races and that this may be why they have been targeted.</li>
         </ul>
     </ul>
    <li> We speak with Vilandris, Ermina, and Miranda. We decide to stay in Triboar and defend the town against the coming attacks. We help evacuate civilians.</li>
    <li> We realize that there are no temples or churches in Triboar, and no clerics. We wonder who or what Vilandris was referring to previously when speaking of a town healer, and cast suspicion on the mayor.</li>
    <ul>
        <li> <a href="party.html#Nassirra">Nassirra</a> decides to investigate the mayor herself. She finds a gnome in town to talk with and asks him about the town's history with respect to the lack of places of worship in town. </li>
        <ul>
            <li> The gnome explains that Triboar was once segregated into three distinct towns on the basis of religion, which caused conflict between the towns. </li>
            <li> When the towns were unified, houses of worship were abolished to prevent conflict on the basis of religion in future. </li> 
        </ul>
        <li> The gnome's story appears to check out, and <a href="party.html#Nassirra">Nassirra</a> concludes that the mayor isn't someone to worry about. </li>

    </ul>
</ul>

        <li> We decimate the enemy with a barrage of ranged attacks. <a href="party.html#L">"L"</a> hurls a flurry of Eldritch Blasts at them. <a href="party.html#Multimodal">Multimodal</a> summons a storm cloud and calls lightning into the fray. <a href="party.html#Nassirra">Nassirra</a> fires her arrows and thorns at them. <a href="party.html#Rasputin">Rasputin</a> throws his darts into the crowd. <a href="party.html#Un-Kell">Ün-Kell</a> tries to emulate <a href="party.html#Nassirra">Nassirra</a>, but misses with his bow. <a href="party.html#Zieg">Zieg</a> summons a spirital weapon to rain blows upon the enemy, and scorches them with sacred flame. </li>

    <li>A bell rings out from the north gate, signaling a breach. We rush toward it and intercept the enemy.</li>

        <li> We see Sir Grimleaf among the wounded, who lost an eye in the battle. <a href="party.html#Zieg">Zieg</a> helps stabilize his wounds. <a href="party.html#Un-Kell">Ün-Kell</a> asks about Miranda, the scout we met before the battle, and locates her. She and <a href="party.html#L">"L"</a> talk about the strange orcs. She explains that the orcs enjoy killing elves particularly, and kill other non-humans indiscriminately, but spare the humans and take them captive. </li>
        </ul>
    <li> We return to Whitewood Palace to see what else we can learn. We find Captain Vilandris in their office. <a href="party.html#L">"L"</a> tells them what we observed in battle and asks for more intelligence from Vilandris. They don't have much new information to share. </li>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <a href="party.html#Multimodal">Multimodal</a> asks Vilandris whether they have heard anything about <a href="npcs.html#Razak">Razak</a>. Vilandris is not optimistic because Elk's Crossing was badly overrun; it is clear that <a href="npcs.html#Razak">Razak</a> is presumed dead. They also tell us that the mayor has taken refugees from the town to Phandalin for protection.</li>
        <li> <a href="party.html#Rasputin">Rasputin</a> is concerned about whether the orcs will return, and feels conflicted about leaving Triboar. Vilandris seems to think they will not return for some time because the orcs will need to rebuild their forces. They suggest that we can help by doing a favor, traveling to Elspire to communicate a request for more troops to the Argent Bastion. </li>
        <li>We return to the barracks for the night. <a href="party.html#Zieg">Zieg</a> and <a href="party.html#Multimodal">Multimodal</a> help the wounded overnight.</li>
    </ul>
    <li>The next morning, we prepare to take the road to Elspire. We try to find horses to borrow to make the journey easier, to no avail.</li>
</ul>
<h2><span id="Elspire">Elspire</span> </h2>
<ul>
<li> We travel by road throughout the day to reach Elspire. As we approach, we see the shining spire of Elspire in the distance, and the city's famous aurora overhead. As we get closer, the party is taken aback by the aurora's beauty, especially <a href="party.html#Multimodal">Multimodal</a>, who had never before seen it. 
<ul>
    <li> We press on to reach the city, and <a href="party.html#Nassirra">Nassirra</a> is particularly weary from the journey. We approach the gate and a guard calls out to us. 
    <ul>
        <li>He asks if we're registered, and we are very confused. He explains that adventuring parties register with the city. We are skeptical but he encourages us to inquire about it at the Bastion.</li>
        <li> He also informs us that we have been summoned to appear at Everjade Palace for an ongoing investigation. He is not able to tell us more details, except that we must appear on the 5th of next month.</li>
        <li> He then gives us directions to the Argent Bastion and we part ways.</li>
    </ul>
    <li> We approach the Bastion and notice guard towers around the perimeter. The aurora is particularly vivid here. A guard stops us, and <a href="party.html#L">"L"</a> explains our business in the capitol. He shows the guard Vilandris' seal on the document in our possession as proof. The guard allows us to proceed.
    <ul>
        <li> We enter the Bastion and see an Aasimar person of clear importance, a Grand Judge, surrounded by guards. She asks what we saw in battle, and we decide to trust her and tell her about the strange orcs that we encountered. We also mention <a href="npcs.html#Razak">Razak</a>, who we learn is a mutual acquaintance, and she notes <a href="party.html#Un-Kell">Ün-Kell</a>'s law blade. Using some kind of magic she sets an inscription of <a href="npcs.html#Razak">Razak</a>'s name on the blade alight.
        <ul>
            <li> The Grand Judge advises that we register as an adventuring party. We seem a bit hesitant but promise to look into it. We ask about lodgings in the area, and <a href="party.html#Zieg">Zieg</a> asks where he can find a bath house. She directs us to an inn called the Verdant Vester in the Harmony District. We thank her and part ways.</li>
        </ul>
    </ul>
    <li> We head to The Verdant Vester, where <a href="party.html#Rasputin">Rasputin</a> immediately orders a vodka. We feel uneasy about needing to register, especially <a href="party.html#Nassirra">Nassirra</a>, and decide to ask fellow adventurers who have registered how they feel about it. We ask the innkeeper where adventurers spend their time off in town, and the innkeep points out a party of adventurers eating together in the inn.
    <ul>
        <li> We approach the party, which consists of a dwarf, a halfling, and two other humanoids. <a href="party.html#L">"L"</a> offers to buy them a round of drinks if they'll answer some questions of ours. We ask whether they're registered, and they affirm. We ask what the benefits are, and it seems that citizenship, land ownership, and insurance/wealth distribution (distributing assets equally upon a hero's death).
        <li> We ask about etiquette and are told not to steal jobs that are spoken for by other adventuring parties.
        <li> We ask where we can obtain weapons and magic items. They patronize us about expecting to buy magic items in a shop. They recommend Grovetender's Sanctuary for animals (per <a href="party.html#Rasputin">Rasputin</a>'s inquiry, to find a mount), Boreal Arms in the Bronze District for weapons, Oaken Oddities for potions.
    </ul>   
     <li> We return to the Bastion and obtain temporary registration papers. We are told that registration takes several weeks.</li>
   </ul> 
</ul>
<h3 id="The Goliath Challenger">The Goliath Challenger</h3>
<ul>
    <li>As we leave, an old Goliath man accompanied by a human spots <a href="party.html#Un-Kell">Ün-Kell</a>, calls him "clanless" (presumably a Goliath slur), and challenges him to combat. He throws a white sword on the ground and instructs <a href="party.html#Un-Kell">Ün-Kell</a> to wield it.</li>
    <ul></span><span id="08/25/2019">
        <li>
            <a href="party.html#Un-Kell">Ün-Kell</a> does not want to fight. He calls out to the older Goliath and asks "Who are you?", but the challenger only replies to tell him to pick up the sword.</li>
        <li>
            <span class="combat"><a href="party.html#Un-Kell">Ün-Kell</a> grabs the sword and feels an unsettling cold sensation emanating from it. The sensation is eerily familiar. He charges at the older man, sword in hand. As he attacks, bitter cold from the blade radiates through him. The older man seems to be protected by some kind of radiant energy. While they fight, the older man says the sword is <a href="party.html#Un-Kell">Ün-Kell</a>'s birthright.</li>
        <li>
            <a href="party.html#Un-Kell">Ün-Kell</a> defeats the older man, knocking him unconscious.</span></li>
        <li>His human companion approaches and introduces himself as Virien, and adjunct professor at a nearby university. He tells us that the older Goliath is named Vaurek, and that he has been searching for his long-lost son.</li>
        <li>
            <a href="party.html#Zieg">Zieg</a> heals the fallen Goliath, who regains consciousness. He smiles and confirms that he believes <a href="party.html#Un-Kell">Ün-Kell</a> is his son.</li>
    </ul>
    <li>We go to Virien's apartment in the Sundial district. During this time, Vaurek and <a href="party.html#Un-Kell">Ün-Kell</a> tell each other about their respective lives. We learn that Vaurek comes from the Northern Goliath tribe. He had a wife, and an infant son who was kidnapped.</li>
    <ul>
        <li>He believes <a href="party.html#Un-Kell">Ün-Kell</a> is that long-lost infant son, because he was able to wield the white blade and survive. Vaurek's infant son was anounted by the god Ralthak.</li>
        <li>Vaurek is a cleric of Ralthak, and was forced into exile when worship of Ralthak became forbidden. It was during his exodus that Vaurek lost his wife and son. Vaurek left their side to find food, and when he returned his wife was dead, and his son was nowhere to be seen.</li>
    </ul>
    <li>After we get to Virien's apartment, we learn that he is eager to part ways with Vaurek now that his son has been found. He volunteers to help us with the research we want to do first.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="Hitting the Books">Hitting the Books</h3>
<ul>
    <li>
        <a href="party.html#Multimodal">Multimodal</a> asks whether there is someone in Elspire who could help us determine <a href="npcs.html#Razak">Razak</a>'s fate. Virien refers her to a Dr. Cloudy at the university who is skilled in divination magic. He offers to bring us to the university. <a href="party.html#Multimodal">Multimodal</a> borrows <a href="npcs.html#Razak">Razak</a>'s lawblade from <a href="party.html#Un-Kell">Ün-Kell</a>, in case its connection to <a href="npcs.html#Razak">Razak</a> proves helpful. <a href="party.html#Multimodal">Multimodal</a>, <a href="party.html#Nassirra">Nassirra</a>, and <a href="party.html#Zieg">Zieg</a> set out to do some research.</li>
    <ul>
        <li>Virien brings the group to the Hausman Library, a three-story building on his university's campus. We encounter a halfling librarian who tells us that we should be able to find Dr. Cloudy in the library.</li>
        <li>We approach an old Tabaxi with gray fur, garbed with flowing robes. Virien introduces him to us as Dr. Cloudy, and we introduce ourselves to him in turn. <a href="party.html#Multimodal">Multimodal</a> asks whether he can help us determine what happened to our friend. We make an appointment to meet in his office after his next class.</li>
        <li>In the meantime, we research some topics in the library.</li>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <a href="party.html#Multimodal">Multimodal</a> attempts to research <a href="lore.html#Necromancy">necromancy</a>, but does not find very much information, because it is a forbidden topic. She learns about three subschools of <a href="lore.html#Necromancy">necromancy</a>: necrolization, which sows decay, animacy, which reanimates the dead, and white <a href="lore.html#Necromancy">necromancy</a>, which preserves dead tissue to prevent decay.</li>
            <li>
                <a href="party.html#Nassirra">Nassirra</a> and <a href="party.html#Zieg">Zieg</a> look into the strange magic-like combat we encountered in the field. They find an old book that has remained undisturbed for many years, in which they learn about <a href="lore.html#Psionics">psionics</a>. </li>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <a href="lore.html#Psionics">Psionics</a> come from a mysterious source, and unlike traditional magic they do not interact with a magical force known as the weave. Like traditional magic, <a href="lore.html#Psionics">psionics</a> requires focus and concentration to perform, but only requires somatic components whereas magic requires material components as well.</li>
                    <li>
                        <a href="lore.html#Psionics">Psionics</a> create forces that interact with the world, and come from the consciousness of the caster. They cannot be used by beings that lack consciousness. </li>
                </ul>
            <li>The group additionally researches three other topics, the <a href="lore.html#The Feywild">Feywild</a>, inter-planar travel, and the eye-stalks we saw in Wave Echo Cave.</li>
            <ul>
                <li>The <a href="lore.html#The Feywild">Feywild</a> is one of the four parallel planes alongside the material plane. It is a manifestation of positive emotion and the domain of life. It contrasts with the Shadowfell, a plane of negative emotion and the domain of death. The <a href="lore.html#The Feywild">Feywild</a>'s capricious nature poses hazards. Some have traveled to the <a href="lore.html#The Feywild">Feywild</a> only to get lost in its forests forever, or to dance unwillingly until they die.</li>
                <li>Travel between planes is dangerous. There are many layers of planes, most notably:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Parallel planes: the <a href="lore.html#The Feywild">Feywild</a>, Shadowfell, the <a href="lore.html#Astral Sea">Astral Sea</a>, and the Ethereal Plane.
                    </li>
                    <li>Inner planes:  e.g., the elemental chaos.
                    </li>
                    <li>Outer planes: correspond to moral alignments, good, evil, chaos, and lawful.</li>
                    <li>Additional planes: pure positive energy, pure negative energy, the nexus (City of Sigil), and an infinite continuum of demiplanes. The space between planes is the veil beyond.</li>
                </ul>
                <li>Travel is achieved through planar portals, where the veil between planes is thin. Natural leylines lead to portals, and can be followed to locate them. Portals can be created using high level spellcasting, which is difficult to cast and requires an item from the target plane.</li>
                <li>The City of Sigil is a hub of inter-planar travel and trade. It contains the Planar Causeway, a circle of teleportation portals that lead to different planes.</li>
                <li>The eyestalks are known as Spectators. They are children of nightmares found in the <a href="lore.html#Astral Sea">astral sea</a>, which is a realm of thought. Anything that has been thought exists in the <a href="lore.html#Astral Sea">astral sea</a>, including strange creatures and weird non-euclidean spaces. Spectators are a lesser type of Beholder, and they can make their way to the material plane under someone's will. We infer that the Spectators we encountered were being controlled by some other entity.</li>
            </ul>
        </ul>
        <li>By the time we finish our research in the library, several hours have elapsed and our meeting with Dr. Cloudy is nigh. Virien escorts us to Dr. Cloudy's office.</li>
        <ul>
            <li>We enter Dr. Cloudy's office and take a seat. He pulls out a small ornate mirror and asks for the name of our friend. <a href="party.html#Multimodal">Multimodal</a> gives him <a href="npcs.html#Razak">Razak</a>'s full name and lawblade. Dr. Cloudy hesitates. We intuit that he is concerned about the potential consequences of spying on someone of such a high rank, but he decides to proceed given that we are concerned for <a href="npcs.html#Razak">Razak</a>'s safety.</li>
            <li>Dr. Cloudy runs his hand along the blade and then enters some kind of trance, swaying back and forth. His eyes go blank. As he sees a vision, a blast of energy pushes him away from his desk.</li>
            <ul>
                <li>He tells us that <a href="npcs.html#Razak">Razak</a> is alive, but gravely injured. He sees him lying in a bed, and can hear the sound of waves from the ocean.</li> 
                <li>He is being cared for by a green-skinned man, perhaps a half-orc.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>
                <a href="party.html#Multimodal">Multimodal</a> and <a href="party.html#Zieg">Zieg</a> thank Dr. Cloudy and tip him for his services, which he was willing to perform at no charge. </li>
            <li>
                <a href="party.html#Zieg">Zieg</a> tells the group that he knows of a small fishing village, and suspects that may be where <a href="npcs.html#Razak">Razak</a> is, based tenuously on the vision and what he knows about the location of Elk's Crossing relative to the Fetid Tangle.</li>
        </ul>
        <li>While the group learned a great deal of information, some of the answers they found were unsatisfying. They decide to find a temple where they can do additional research.</li>
        <li>As they leave the library, <a href="party.html#Multimodal">Multimodal</a> spots another Firbolg on campus. She excitedly approaches the student, who is far less excited about the conversation. The student advises her to disguise herself as a human in certain, less-savory parts of the city. She thanks him for his advice, bids him good luck in his studies, and allows him to take his leave.</li>
        <li>
            <a href="party.html#Nassirra">Nassirra</a> spots a half-elf teenager who gives off thief-like vibes. She decides to ask the teen about thieves guilds in town where she might be able to get the kind of information you don't find in books. In exchange for a few gold pieces, the teen tells her about the Larson Brothers laundry in the River District, where she can speak a code phrase "my eye wanders" for entry.</li>
        <li>We go to the Sun Sanctuary, a temple of Pelor that <a href="party.html#Zieg">Zieg</a> has made pilgrimage to in the past. There is a library there available only to servants of Pelor. </li>
        <ul>
            <li>We encounter Father Blackheart, an older dwarf gentleman that <a href="party.html#Zieg">Zieg</a> knows. He was promoted since he last saw <a href="party.html#Zieg">Zieg</a> and is now the archbishop, a very powerful position in the faith. He gives us his blessing to research whatever we like in the library, and to pick his brain.</li>
            <li>
                <a href="party.html#Zieg">Zieg</a> investigates <a href="lore.html#Necromancy">necromancy</a> again here and finds far more information than we found at the university library. We find a book about the history of <a href="lore.html#Necromancy">necromancy</a> in Arkovia.</li>
            <ul>
                <li>An ancient ruler's royal mage dabbled in <a href="lore.html#Necromancy">necromancy</a>. The mage turned the king into an undead creature. The king retained his wits in undeath but devoured mortal flesh, and held a long reign of terror. </li>
                <li>An ancient ruler on another continent became a lich and destroyed the land. This pre-empted an exodus of a handfull of survivors who settled into Arkovia. Necromancy is highly stigmatized in Arkovia in part because it is considered an original sin in the story of Arkovia's settlement.</li>
                <li>In the start of the second era, the region surrounding present day Lucav was plagued by bloody wars. It was called the hollows, a "land awash in death". Goliath and Dwarven necromancers raised armies of the dead.
                </li>
                <li>In the late second era, a cult worshipped a deity of the Shadowfell who punished the wealthy and sinful ruling class. Worship of that deity has since been banned.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <li>
                <a href="party.html#Multimodal">Multimodal</a> investigates the Eladrin, Na'Zandar's people.</li>
            <ul>
                <li>The Eladrin were indiginous to Arkovia, and the namesake of the city Elspire ("Elf Spire"). Originally dwelled in the <a href="lore.html#The Feywild">Feywild</a> and are considered ancestors of modern-day elves.</li>
                <li>The Eladrin became oppressive overlords over the first men of Arkovia (those who fled in the exodus), who successfully rebelled against them.</li>
            </ul>
        </ul>
    </ul>
</ul>

<h3 id="Shop til You Drop">Shop 'til You Drop</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Meanwhile, <a href="party.html#Rasputin">Rasputin</a>, <a href="party.html#L">"L"</a>, and <a href="party.html#Un-Kell">Ün-Kell</a> decide to visit Oaken Oddities to get some sweet, sweet loot. </li>
        <ul>
            <li>Before hitting up the magic shop, the group gets some food with Vaurek, so that Vaurek and <a href="party.html#Un-Kell">Ün-Kell</a> can get a little bit of father-son bonding time. And meat.
            </li>
            <li>As they approach Oaken Oddities, they are confronted by a group of protestors bearing signs that read "Magic is Murder". They ask the protestors what all the fuss is about, and the protestors explain that the body parts of living things are used to craft magic items. <a href="party.html#Rasputin">Rasputin</a> pulls out the head of King Groll, a bugbear we defeated in one of our earlier encounters, and takes a long sniff of it to show that he is more than on board with killing creatures and using their body parts for whatever. The protestors look horrified, and allow the group to pass.</li>
            <li>Inside they see a whimsical shop where tiny wooden automata crawl along the walls and various other shop surfaces. The shop is run by a gnomish shopkeeper clad in bright colors, including brightly colored hair that transitions from pink to teal in color. She greets the group and asks what kind of price range they're able to accommodate.</li>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <a href="party.html#Rasputin">Rasputin</a> expresses interest in items that would help him survive combat better. The shopkeeper brings out some bloody hand wrappings that catch his eye. In an attempt to barter, <a href="party.html#Rasputin">Rasputin</a> offers up the ankheg egg he has held on to since Wave Echo Cave. The shopkeeper regrets to inform him that the ankheg zygote is no more. It has ceased to be.</li>
                <li>
                    <a href="party.html#Un-Kell">Ün-Kell</a> is similarly interested in items that could grant him protection in combat, and perhaps swiftness. He offers to help "deal with" the protestors in exchange for a discount, but the shopkeeper seems unbothered by the protest. He ends up buying a magical charm that grants him temporary hitpoints when he kills an enemy.</li>
                <li>The shopkeeper tells them about various other items that are available, including force eggs, which are magical grenades that she apparently makes herself. <a href="party.html#Rasputin">Rasputin</a> expresses great interest in these. She also offers jewelry for sale, rings that protect the wearer from specific elements. Finally, she has several ritual spell scrolls that catch <a href="party.html#L">"L"</a>'s attention, and he purchases two spell scrolls, including one that creates a safe place for us to rest no matter where we are. He also purchases a ring to protect himself from poison and necrotic damage.</li>
                <li>
                    <a href="party.html#Rasputin">Rasputin</a> haggles with the shopkeeper, trading his magical Zivil stone toward the cost of the bloody wrappings and a magical sash.</li>
            </ul>
        </ul>
    </ul>
    <h3 id="Back to the Bastion">Back to the Bastion</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>We regroup back at the Argent Bastion. We communicate our findings and procurements to one another, then stop by the quartermaster. <a href="party.html#Zieg">Zieg</a> buys diamonds that he can use as material components to revive one of us if we fall in battle. We also note that the quartermaster stocks filters of lyceal, which can allow magic casters to regain their spellcasting capabilities without the need for a rest. They are very expensive.</li>
        <li>
            <a href="party.html#Nassirra">Nassirra</a> wants to head to the River District to enter the thieves' guild the half-elf teen told her about. We decide to head there as a group.</li>
    </ul>
<h3 id="Where Thieves Break Through">Where Thieves Break Through</h3>
<ul>
    <li>We head south for several hours until we find ourselves in the River District near the evening. It stinks of fish and lumber, and the people we encounter are clearly no-nonsense. As the surroundings get seedier, <a href="party.html#Multimodal">Multimodal</a> disguises herself as a human to draw less attention. We ask a passerby for directions to the laundry.</li>
    <li>When we arrive at the laundry, <a href="party.html#Nassirra">Nassirra</a> tries to use the pass phrase on an employee outside with a laundry cart, but he seems confused. He says that we should talk to his boss, Christoff.</li>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <a href="party.html#Nassirra">Nassirra</a> enters and speaks to Christoff, who tells her to speak to his brother. She and <a href="party.html#Un-Kell">Ün-Kell</a> head to a back room and meet a man who gives them a mysterious coin. The man directs them to go to a soda fountain across the street, order anything they want, and present the coin. He cautions that exactly two people must be present.</li>
        <li>They proceed across the street and are served by a halfling man. Upon seeing the coin, the gnome proceeds to make a drink. A Tiefling woman then ushers them off. She leads them to the thieves guild, blindfolded.</li>
        <li>A horrible smell wafts through the air, and <a href="party.html#Nassirra">Nassirra</a> suspects they are traveling through a sewer. Suddenly the Tiefling woman tells them to stop and hide. <a href="party.html#Nassirra">Nassirra</a> can barely make out three humanoids, and hears them talking about a woman in town, as though that is a situation they have people "on".</li>
        <li>After they leave, the Tiefling woman opens a secret door to a larger chamber where an Aasimar woman, dwarven woman, and the halfling man they ordered a drink from upstairs. The halfling man, Rolf, welcomes them to the Cistern of the Eye.</li></span>
        <span id="09/28/2019"><li>The Aasimar woman reveals herself as Yssa, the mechant who sold <a href="party.html#Zieg">Zieg</a> a luck stone in Phandalin. She tells <a href="party.html#Nassirra">Nassirra</a> that the thieves guild is an organization called "The Eye". <a href="party.html#Nassirra">Nassirra</a> has heard rumblings about the group, rumors of a spy organization, but no details.</li>    
    </ul>
    <li>
        <a href="party.html#Nassirra">Nassirra</a> tries to gather some intel from Yssa about the threads we've been following. </li>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <a href="party.html#Nassirra">Nassirra</a> asks about the orcs we encountered and proposes a mutually beneficial intelligence sharing arrangement. She says that the orcs are now doing strange magic that she does not think they have the intelligence to learn on their own. Yssa says that she knows about the war in the south and agrees intel is important, but is unwilling to divulge more, except to clarify that the orcs aren't too unintelligent to innovate but they are a very traditional culture, so it is strange that they have recently gone against their traditional means of combat. The Eye wants to know who is pulling their strings.</li>
    </ul>
    <li>Yssa says The Eye would be willing to share information if <a href="party.html#Nassirra">Nassirra</a> proves herself to to the organization. </li>
    <ul>
        <li>The Eye needs a new asset to go to Lucav and retrieve a tome from the House of Record that has information about the Markova family. Yssa promises to share information in exchange for the tome.</li>
        <ul>
            <li>The people of Lucav worship Zivilyn, a god of knowledge. Because knowledge is sacred to them, the House of Record serves as both a library and a temple. It is protected by guards and surveillance. </li>
            <li>The undead have been attacking Lucav in increasing numbers. During such an attack, we may have an opportunity to enter the House of Record unseen.</li>
        </ul>
        <li>The Eye also seeks a sample of the substance called Bloodstone, which is rumored to exist in the northwest corner of the continent.</li>
    </ul>
    <li>During <a href="party.html#Nassirra">Nassirra</a>'s conversation with Yssa, the tiefling who escorted her to The Eye pulls a blue luminescent ribbon from behind her ear and passes it to Yssa. <a href="party.html#Nassirra">Nassirra</a> intuits that this is some kind of magical information sharing system.</li>
    <li>Before parting ways, Yssa offers to sell off-market goods to <a href="party.html#Nassirra">Nassirra</a>, if she is interested. She buys some illicit drugs, poison, and a set of thieves tools.</li>
    <li>Finally, Yssa tells <a href="party.html#Nassirra">Nassirra</a> that she can contact us via the dwarven woman she met earlier. <a href="party.html#Nassirra">Nassirra</a> and <a href="party.html#Un-Kell">Ün-Kell</a> head take leave and return to the group.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="Hear Ye, Hear Ye">Hear Ye, Hear Ye</h3>

<ul>
    <li>On the street, we hear a town cryer advertising the upcoming King's Address. <a href="party.html#Zieg">Zieg</a> asks a nearby Tabaxi about it, who tells him that the King's Address is something of an announcement about the current state of the country, a bit of news bulletin. </li>
    <li>
        <a href="party.html#Nassirra">Nassirra</a> and <a href="party.html#Un-Kell">Ün-Kell</a> rejoin the group and communicate what transpired with The Eye. We suspect the Eladrin might somehow be involved in the orc mischief. The rest of us relay information we just learned about the King's Address. We decide it might be worth listening to in order to get more information about the war, or at least to know what the King sees fit to tell his subjects about it.</li>
    <li>We decide that our next step should be to go to Lucav, given that several of the threads we're following lead there. There may be a boat of some kind that could get us there in the River District. Before we do, we decided to rest and plan our journey, and start heading to The Red Scale Restaurant & Inn. </li>
    <li>On our way to the inn, we encounter two people being pursued by a group of unsavory individuals. <a href="party.html#Zieg">Zieg</a>, <a href="party.html#Un-Kell">Ün-Kell</a>, <a href="party.html#Rasputin">Rasputin</a>, and <a href="party.html#L">"L"</a> rush after them.
</ul>

<h3 id="A Foul Wind">A Foul Wind</h3>
<ul>
    <li>
        <span class="combat">We engage in combat with the bandits pursuing two individuals, a raven-haired man and a robed Aasimar. </span></li>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <span class="combat">Some of the bandits are mystical magic casters and the others wield blades. <a href="party.html#Nassirra">Nassirra</a> climbs onto a nearby roof to get a better vantage point, and strikes one of the thugs with an arrow. As they attack, we notice that the mystics appear to attack with some sort of thunder ability.  <a href="party.html#L">"L"</a> commands the thugs to halt. A raven-haired man, one of the people being pursued, joins the battle. <a href="party.html#Rasputin">Rasputin</a> kills one of the mystics and wounds a fighter. <a href="party.html#Multimodal">Multimodal</a> summons a magical elk into the bandits' midst as a distraction. <a href="party.html#Un-Kell">Ün-Kell</a> flies into a rage and kills another mystic. Vaurek fights among us, but first heals himself as he had not yet recovered the health he lost when dueling <a href="party.html#Un-Kell">Ün-Kell</a>. The thugs band together and kill <a href="party.html#Multimodal">Multimodal</a>'s elk. <a href="party.html#Zieg">Zieg</a> blasts them with a fireball. Vaurek, <a href="party.html#Zieg">Zieg</a>, and <a href="party.html#Multimodal">Multimodal</a> heal the party. Within minutes, we whittle the group down to a sole surviving mystic, who we knock unconscious and decide to question later on. </li></span>
        <li>The people who were being pursued introduce themselves to us. The robed Aasimar calls herself Sarah and the raven-haired man gives us the name Ezra. <a href="party.html#Multimodal">Multimodal</a> suspects these are not their real names, and that the Aasimar woman is, or was, a member of high-society, now fleeing the city for reasons she can't divulge. <a href="party.html#Nassirra">Nassirra</a> suspects the Aasimar may be the woman who the armored men she encountered in the sewers were talking about. <a href="party.html#Nassirra">Nassirra</a> offers her protection, and uses The Eye's code language to test the waters. Sarah declines the offer.</li>
        <li>Sarah asks us whether we have seen a tiefling and a Tabaxi man together in town. We haven't, but Vaurek says he saw them years ago, possibly in the Soot District. He offers to take Sarah and Ezra to the place where he saw them last. We agree to part ways. Before we do, <a href="party.html#L">"L"</a> writes the name of our adventuring party in his book of shadows and tears off a piece of the page to give to Sarah. He explains that it is a piece of his soul, which she could use to find us again. As they leave, we realized that Ezra's eyes were closed the whole time, but we can see a faint blue light emanating from behind his eyelids.</li>
    </ul>
    <li>As we search the fallen bandits for items, we find strange tokens and wooden coins with fronds on them. We decide to take the unconscious mystic with us to the inn. We put a red cloak on him, remove his hood, and disguise tattoos on his face that might reveal his identity with makeup. We also put a wig on him, for later snatching. </li>
    <ul>
        <li>As we approach the inn, <a href="party.html#Rasputin">Rasputin</a> splashes liquor on the captive mystic so that he can pass for our sloppy drunk friend. Once inside, some frat boys fall for the ruse and sympathize with us. We manage to reserve a room.</li>
        <li>While we wait for our room, a large group enters the inn after us. There are humans and dwarves in the group, and reclusive people in loose-fitting robes with bone-like skin, horns or spikes protruding from their cheekbones, some have no eyes, others no mouth. We infer that this is some other race of people we have not encountered before. As a group, they appear to be injured and ill. </li>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <a href="party.html#Zieg">Zieg</a> does what he can to help heal them. He asks them what happened. One of the dwarves says they just arrived from Lilygrove, located in The Hollows, which is a valley in the northeast where Lucav is. They are refugees of an undead attack in the region. <a href="party.html#Zieg">Zieg</a> buys food for them and heals the three most wounded members of the group. </li>
            <li>A survivor describes the undead attack. Undead attacks are not unusual in the spring, especially when mists creep in, but this one was unusual. An eerie melody played and mists creeped in over the town just before the undead descended on it, as though the melody summoned them. They fought with clawing and biting, and moved more quickly this year. The ranks of the Lucavi Knight patrols who defend the town have thinned in battle. He warns us to steer clear of Lilygrove. </li>
            <li>
                <a href="party.html#Nassirra">Nassirra</a> and <a href="party.html#L">"L"</a> overhear the conversation. They approach and offer to help fight off the undead attacks. <a href="party.html#Zieg">Zieg</a> asks the refugee to draw a map for us. He gives us directions to Lilygrove: head east out of Elspire following the King's road, then turn north before we hit the coast. Follow the north road past Ashmore, a mining outpost, keep north and you will find Lilygrove.</li>
            <li>He tells us that the Lucavi Knights have special swords that help combat the undead, and are trained to fight them by a champion. <a href="party.html#Un-Kell">Ün-Kell</a> asks whether their blades are anything like his icy sword, but it seems not.</li>
        </ul>
        <li>
            <a href="party.html#Rasputin">Rasputin</a> took the prisoner upstairs to our room. When the rest of the group meets him, he is staring down the prisoner and his skin has turned black. <a href="party.html#Zieg">Zieg</a> creates a Zone of Truth around the prisoner, says "You've got 10 minutes" to the group, then leaves the room. We wake the prisoner and begin questioning him. </li>
        <ul>
            <li>He seems to be a member of an air elemental cult. He says Sarah is part of some cult prophecy, something about bringing the masters from the heavens. <a href="party.html#Multimodal">Multimodal</a> summons a dust devil to show her own command of the elements and convince him to comply. He tells us that the cult leader, Favric, says the masters will come whether we want them to or not. Favric trains the cultists to be loyal and asks them for tribute. The prisoner doesn't know when the masters will come and says it's because we mortals can't possibly fathom their plans. He mentions the ruins of an old city near Westport. We recall mention of the ruins from <a href="lore.html#Journal">Hamun's journal</a>, a place called Thundertree. After divulging that information, the prisoner refuses to cooperate further. <span class="combat"><a href="party.html#Multimodal">Multimodal</a>'s dust devil throws him out the window of the inn.</span> </li>
            <li>A passerby in the hallway hears the commotion and asks <a href="party.html#Zieg">Zieg</a> what's going on. <a href="party.html#Zieg">Zieg</a> says what anyone says to justify horrible deeds, that we are doing the Lord's work.</li>
            <li>We decide we can't stay at the inn, since others saw us enter the inn with the cultist. We stealthily exit from the shattered window.</li>
        </ul>
        <li>We ask a stranger in the street for directions to the next nearest in, which is in the outskirts of the city. When we get there, we find that it's already fully booked, and the city is full of refugees from Elk's Crossing, Triboar, and Lilygrove. We head outside the eastern city gate and find a refugee tent city to blend in with. <a href="party.html#L">"L"</a> takes some time to transcribe a ritual into his book, then summons a tiny hut for us to safely rest in. We comfortably spend the night there. <a href="party.html#Nassirra">Nassirra</a> and <a href="party.html#Un-Kell">Ün-Kell</a> investigate the refugee situation in the city.</li>

<h3 id="Travel Arrangements">Travel Arrangements</h3>

<ul>
    <li>We decide to stay in Elspire for the King's Address. <a href="party.html#L">"L"</a> decides to check in with a mercenary guild in town called The Silver Scabbard. <a href="party.html#Rasputin">Rasputin</a> decides to go with him. <a href="party.html#Zieg">Zieg</a> and <a href="party.html#Multimodal">Multimodal</a> go to the River District to hire a river boat to take us toward Lucav, then head to a bath house in the Harmony District.  </li>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <a href="party.html#Nassirra">Nassirra</a> and <a href="party.html#Un-Kell">Ün-Kell</a> discover that the Scarlet Vigil has been deployed to use crowd control methods on refugees in the streets, and are not exactly treating them with kindness. They find no evidence of any other strange activity.</li>
            <li>
                <a href="party.html#L">"L"</a> and <a href="party.html#Rasputin">Rasputin</a> head to the Silver Scabbard. An actual silver scabbard sits above the doorway, and they find mercenaries sharing war stories with one another. <a href="party.html#Rasputin">Rasputin</a>'s interest is piqued. <a href="party.html#L">"L"</a> shoots the shit with his half-orc contact, "K". Nearby, a dwarf female mercenary named "T" is deep in her cups. <a href="party.html#L">"L"</a> asks "K" what contracts are available. He says the Knights of Lucav are contracting fighters to defend the town. Supposedly there is a necromancer in the northern foothills sending undead to attack the town. <a href="party.html#Rasputin">Rasputin</a> decides to join the mercenary guild. He pays a fee and is assigned a number, #13. He gets a scabbard. Some chit-chat reveals that initiates get number identifiers, and higher ranked members get letters.</li>
            <li>
                <a href="party.html#Zieg">Zieg</a> and <a href="party.html#Multimodal">Multimodal</a> head to the River District and approach the boatyard, where they find an older dark-skinned lady who introduces herself as a Jaina, captain of a riverfaring vessel. They tell her where our party is headed and she says she can take us to Karethra, a fishing village in the east, and we can head north from there. She offers us a rate of 3 gold per person for passage. They charter her boat under our adventuring party name (GRADS) to take us to Karethra the next day with an afternoon departure time. Then they head to the Harmony District and find a bathhouse called Afra's Well, named for the goddess Afra, who some would regard as a sister-goddess to Pelor. An Elf greets them as they enter the bathhouse and explain the packages available, rates, and rules. Customers must be nude, can have individual rooms or bathe in the common area, and there are some other perks. They opt to spring for the executive package at a rate of 3 gold 5 silver per person. Afterwards, they feel fuully rejuvenated.</li>
        </ul>     </span>
    <li>
        <span id="11/02/2019">We regroup at the Verdant Vesture and prepare for the King's Address.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="State of the Kingdom">The State of the Kingdom</h3>

<ul>
    <li>We head to the Palace District to witness the King's Address, where we encounter a large crowd. There is a wall surrounding the Emerald Palace and surrounding areas where the aristocracy live, surely to keep out riff-raff like ourselves. Large government buildings loom, interconnected by bridges from upper floors, and there are magically powered cable cars traversing the sky. Obelisks with guards wearing cloaks like the one Daren Edermath wore are situated along the perimeter.</li>
    <li>The crowd gathers in a large square from which we can see the Emerald Palace. It reeks of body odor. <a href="part.html#Multimodal">Multimodal</a> and <a href="party.html#Nassirra">Nassirra</a> are uncomfortable with the number of people in the crowd.</li>
    <li>A woman garbed in a fancy blue and white dress robe takes the stage. She approaches a bronze crescent-shaped podium and speaks to the crowd with a booming voice, amplified by thaumaturgy. She introduces herself as Angara Mar, regent for the boy prince. Then she introduces the King and steps aside for him to speak.</li>
    <ul>
        <li>The King steps forward to address the crowd. He wears decorative green and gold garb, a gaudy crown, and a golden ceremonial breast plate. The Queen stands off to the side, adorned in beautiful robes. <a href="party.html#Zieg">Zieg</a> is starstruck at the sight of the royal couple. <a href="party.html#Nassirra">Nassirra</a> blows a raspberry. A nearby Dwarven citizen shoots her a dirty look.</li>
        <li>The King welcomes the crowd and proceeds to speak. </li>
        <ul>
            <li>He talks about the tragedy that befell his family, alluding to the death of his daughter, and states that his youngest child, his son and heir, is in good health.</li> 
            <li>He announces that the kingdom will soon be testing new airship technology and urges citizens not to be alarmed should they see the airships.</li>
            <li>He mentions the "tragedy" of <a href="npcs.html#Glasstaff">Glasstaff</a>'s death, which raises an eyebrow or two in our party. His death has left a power vacuum in the Lord's Round, leadership of the Lord's Alliance.</li>
            <li>The leader of an allied nation abdicated the throne, contributing to destablization in the region.</li>
            <li>He acknowledges the rumors of cultists causing chaos in the city and assures citizens that crime is low and they are safe.</li>
            <li>He acknowledges the refugees in the city from Triboar, Elk's Crossing, and Lilygrove, and bids his citizens to treat them with kindness and compassion.</li>
            <li>He begins to solicit volunteers to join the Scarlet Vigil in the war effort, but is cut off as a spire arrow strikes his breastplate, but appears to shatter harmlessly on imact. It looks like an assassination attempt. We notice that Angara Mar appears unphased by what transpired.</li>
        </ul>
        <li>We see someone dressed as a sentinel of the spire running off from the direction of the arrow.</li>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <a href="party.html#Rasputin">Rasputin</a> attempts to pursue the would-be assassin but can't get through the crowd of panicking people in the square.</li>
            <li>
                <a href="party.html#L">"L"</a> sends his familiar Bob after the assailant, and Bob quicky flies out of range of <a href="party.html#L">"L"</a>
's psychic connection with him.</li>
            <li>
                <a href="party.html#Rasputin">Rasputin</a> is stopped at the gate by guards. He takes a swig from his flask and backtracks, then seeks out the rest of the party.</li>
            <li>We hear a bell ring loudly throughout the city and notice that everyone is on high alert. We are pushed out of the Palace District and into the Sundial District, along with the rest of the crowd.</li>
            <li>We find an alley way that's out of sight where <a href="party.html#L">"L"</a> resummons Bob to find out what he saw. Bob identifies the assailant as a man who ran across rooftops. <a href="party.html#L">"L"</a> asks him to draw a sketch of the man. Bob tries, but is an owl. The sketch is useless.</li>
        </ul>
    </ul>
</ul>

<h3 id="Change of Plans">Change of Plans</h3>
<ul>
    <li>We head to the River District to see whether we can still make our scheduled departure from the city. As we pass through the Sundial District, we see guards lining up refugees and interrogating them. We get the sense that the guards are looking for a scapegoat, and refugees are an easy target. <a href="party.html#Nassirra">Nassirra</a> considers getting rid of the cloak she found in Daren's residence after his untimely demise, to avoid suspicion for the crime. As we pass through the city, we learn that martial law is in effect, and no one is allowed to leave the city.</li> 
    <li>We make it to the River District where <a href="party.html#Multimodal">Multimodal</a> and <a href="party.html#Zieg">Zieg</a> lead the group to Jaina, the boat captain we made arrangements with. The boatyard is under heavy guard, and we see sailors barred from boarding their boats. Jaina is one of them. We ask her what's going on after she butts heads with a guard, and she pretends not to recognize is. She loudly announces that she needs a drink at the nearby tavern, The Soiled Skivvies, and shoots us a knowing glance. Just as the situation begins to escalate, we find the tavern and enter.</li>
    <ul>
        <li>The tavern is extremely busy and loud. We find Jaina and talk with her. She tells us what we already know for the most part, that the city is on lockwdown and there's no getting out, at least not without some serious spycraft. The city has been on lockdown before, she said, and it could be days before anyone is allowed freedom of movement.</li>
        <li>We mention the airships the King announced. She doesn't know anything useful to share with us, but we see a glint in her eye. She is excited about the technology.</li>
        <li>We ask her about the King's family based on what he mentioned in the speech, but she doesn't have much information.</li>
        <li>We formulate a potential plan. <a href="party.html#Multimodal">Multimodal</a> could disguise herself with Firbolg magic to look like a guard, and demand to board Jaina's boat for inspection. Then <a href="party.html#Zieg">Zieg</a> can create a fog cloud to obscure the rest of the party as they too board the vessel.</li>
        <li>We decide whether we want to stay in the city and follow leads or try to depart. Our plan to leave is very risky, and there are some interesting leads we could pursue in town. We decide to stay.</li>
    </ul>
</ul>

<h3 id="The Game is Afoot">The Game is Afoot</h3>
<ul>
    <li>We decide to split up and go back to our respective sources to find answers, if possible. <a href="party.html#Multimodal">Multimodal</a> and <a href="party.html#Zieg">Zieg</a> return to the temple to see Father Blackheart. <a href="party.html#L">"L"</a> and <a href="party.html#Rasputin">Rasputin</a> visit the Silver Scabbard. <a href="party.html#Un-Kell">Ün-Kell</a> and <a href="party.html#Nassirra">Nassirra</a> go back to The Eye to find out if there's another way out of the city, if we need to escape.</li>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <a href="party.html#Nassirra">Nassirra</a> and <a href="party.html#Un-Kell">Ün-Kell</a> go back to the soda shop they visited previously to get to The Eye. They see a large crowd of people and are told that The Eye is at capacity with other citizens turning to their services in a panic.
        </li>
        <li>
            <a href="party.html#L">"L"</a> and <a href="party.html#Rasputin">Rasputin</a> go to the Silver Scabbard and find it to be almost completely empty. Only "Z", a dragonborn mercenary known to <a href="party.html#L">"L"</a>, remained behind. He tells them that the bells ringing means there's a criminal at large, and the mercenaries are out for the bounty. "Z" comes across as an unintelligent meathead, but <a href="party.html#L">"L"</a> knows it's one of "Z"'s cons.
        </li>
        <li>
            <a href="party.html#Zieg">Zieg</a> and <a href="party.html#Multimodal">Multimodal</a> return to the Sun Sanctuary. We ask Father Blackheart to commune with Pelor to get information about the assassination attempt. We ask him to keep the information we've asked about between us. He performs a ritual at the altar, looks upon the sun symbol of Pelor committed to stained glass, and receives Pelor's word. We ask three yes/no questions of Pelor.
        </li>
        <ul>
            <li>Was the assassination attempted staged? Pelor says <span style="font-weight: bold; color: #ff9900; font-style:italic;">no.</span></li>
            <li>Is the assassin still in Elspire? <span style="font-weight: bold; color: #ff9900; font-style:italic;">Yes.</span></li>
            <li>Was anyone currently in the Lord's Round party to Ian Albreck's wicked schemes? <span style="font-weight: bold; color: #ff9900; font-style:italic;">Yes.</span></li>
        </ul>
        <li>We ask Father Blackheart some of the questions that we couldn't get answers to earlier.</li>
        <ul>
            <li>He tells us that the Lord's Round is an elite council that controls the laws of the land. Its members are appointed from within the Lord's Alliance. There are 12 members of the Lord's Round, and one is next in line to succeed the throne should all other heirs perish. If the heir is young enough, this one Lord's Round member would serve as Regent. We correctly infer that Angara Mar holds this position in the Lord's Round currently. We communicate that Angara seemed unbothered by the assassination attempt.</li>
            <li>He also tells us about the family. He says some believe the King is cursed. His oldest daughter disappeared before the youngest boy was born. She had been the original heir. Rumor has it that she was going to kill the young prince once he was born to secure her position in the line. Eliantha, the middle sister, mysteriously disappeared at some point, perhaps in a kidnapping. The youngest sister has never been seen in public. Finally, Father Blackheart confirms that Seren, the youngest and heir to the throne, fell ill several years ago. He is weak and frail still.</li>
            <li>We ask for more information about Angara Mar, since she seems a likely suspect in the assassination plot and whatever ills have befallen the royal children. He tells us that Angara comes from the highest-ranking members of the Sentinels of the Spire. She wields great power and has a steely air about her.</li>
        </ul>
    </ul>
    <li>We regroup and communicate what each pair has learned during our research. After we do, we notice a concerning disturbance in the city.</li>
    <ul>
        <li>Refugees have been attacked maliciously, it appears that the guards have gotten out of hand. We follow a trail of blood that leads to the Aurora District, near the outer wall of Elspire, leading to a military base called The Bulwark. It's close to the palace, which is strategic for guarding the royal family, and close to the Aurora District to keep the rich safe. Historically, it is located near the northern wall of the city to fend of attacks from Dwarven nations to the north. <a href="party.html#Zieg">Zieg</a> tries to pursue the trail of blood and help the refugees, but we decide taking on the guards in their place of power is unwise.</li>
    </ul>
</ul>

<h3 id="People in Glasstaff Houses">People in Glasstaff Houses...</h3>
<ul>
    <li>We recall that <a href="party.html#L">"L"</a> carries <a href="npcs.html#Glasstaff">Glasstaff</a>'s namesake staff, and decide to be careful to conceal it. We remain skeptical and concerned that the King spoke so highly of <a href="npcs.html#Glasstaff">Glasstaff</a> in light of his crimes, especially because we are due to speak at his posthumous trial. We decide to try and find <a href="npcs.html#Glasstaff">Glasstaff</a>'s residence for information we could use to our advantage.</li>
    <ul>
        <li>First, we need to find out which house belonged to <a href="npcs.html#Glasstaff">Glasstaff</a>, then find a way to get inside. We decide to exploit tensions in the city between the servant class and the wealthy ruling class, currently controlling everyone's movements in wake of the assassination attempt. We go to a tavern in the Sundial District called The Brass Hearth. <a href="party.html#Multimodal">Multimodal</a> identifies some people dressed as servants or similar. She approaches them, complains about the wealthy oppressors, and offers to buy them a round of drinks.</li>
        <li>As it happens, one of the peasants at the table once worked for <a href="npcs.html#Glasstaff">Glasstaff</a>. He is dumb as dirt, which was consistent with his job duties. He tells us that <a href="npcs.html#Glasstaff">Glasstaff</a> tasked him with retrieving dirt and bringing it back to his home. We suspect he may have used the dirt to create mud golems or some other sinister thing. He starts talking about his current occupation, which also involves sifting through mud and finding some edible creature he can't name, and we quickly change the topic. We ask where <a href="npcs.html#Glasstaff">Glasstaff</a>'s house is, in directly, but we quickly realize he is not picking up the hints we're putting down. <a href="party.html#Nassirra">Nassirra</a> and <a href="party.html#Multimodal">Multimodal</a> persuade them to charge the house and take what they were owed. They prove to be very easily persuaded and set off toward the house. We follow behind stealthily. </li>
        <ul>
            <li>When we arrive, we find that the house isn't far from where the assassination attempt took place earlier in the day. The house is kept under guard, some kind of gesture to "honor" the piece of wizardly shit.</li>
            <li>The servants try to force their way past the guards. The guards don't want to harm them, and they are clearly outclassed. One of them punches the guard's heavy plate armor and injures himself. Once we've determined the guards don't pose a real threat to them, we decide to take advantage of the distraction and sneak around back.</li>
            <li>Once in the back yard, <a href="party.html#Multimodal">Multimodal</a> checks for traps, but finds nothing. <a href="party.html#Nassirra">Nassirra</a> uses her thieves' tools to pick the lock on the back door, and we enter into a kitchen. The house is luxurious, and <a href="party.html#Nassirra">Nassirra</a>'s lust for treasure shows. <a href="party.html#Rasputin">Rasputin</a> begins quietly stealing silverware and other pricey items.</li>
            <li>
                <a href="party.html#L">"L"</a> and <a href="party.html#Zieg">Zieg</a> investigate the house. They find a spare bedroom and search a seemingly empty closet with a secret latch in the floor. <a href="party.html#L">"L"</a> raises the latch and its corresponding trap door to reveal ... pristine dirt. It appears to have been put there magically. <a href="party.html#L">"L"</a> touches the dirt with his glass staff and the dirt dissolves away into sand, revealing a staircase down. <a href="party.html#Zieg">Zieg</a> stealthily beckons the rest of us to come with them down the stairs.</li>
            <li>We descend into a secret basement, guided by light from <a href="party.html#Zieg">Zieg</a>'s mace. The walls are stone, taupe in color, and entirley too smooth to be made by human hands. Crystals placed in fixtures adorn the walls periodically. <a href="party.html#Multimodal">Multimodal</a> uses detect magic and notes an auro of evocation magic emanating from the crystals, and a touch of ambient necrotic energy in the room.</li>
            <li>
                <a href="party.html#Rasputin">Rasputin</a> notices a stone door on the opposite side of the room. As the rest of the party considers how best to investigate the door, <a href="party.html#Rasputin">Rasputin</a> tries to open it. Runes light up on the handle, and we hear the ominous sound of ground and earth shifting in the room. <span class="combat">A large, round hole opens up in the center of the room beneath <a href="party.html#Multimodal">Multimodal</a> and <a href="party.html#Un-Kell">Ün-Kell</a>, who fall into it and encounter <a href="npcs.html#Glasstaff">Glasstaff</a>'s stone golems.</li></span></span>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <span id="11/29/2019"><span class="combat"><a href="party.html#Multimodal">Multimodal</a> stands up and surveys the pit around her. She sees several stone sentries, and launches an ineffectual ice knife at one of them. <a href="party.html#Zieg">Zieg</a> helps raise <a href="party.html#Multimodal">Multimodal</a> out of the pit, then summons a spiritual weapon to attack a nearby golem. The stone sentries raise some kind of sensor and fire on <a href="party.html#Zieg">Zieg</a>. <a href="party.html#Un-Kell">Ün-Kell</a> becomes enraged and strikes repeatedly at the sentry bots. <a href="party.html#Nassirra">Nassirra</a> launches her swords at the sentries, then notices the large golem attacking <a href="party.html#Rasputin">Rasputin</a>. <a href="party.html#L">"L"</a> hears a voice calling to him, compelling him to create a hypnotic pattern. He creates a sparkly illusion of a unicorn with rainbows. <a href="party.html#Un-Kell">Ün-Kell</a> becomes completely transfixed by the sight, until <a href="party.html#L">"L"</a> comes to his senses and breaks the spell.</span> </li>
                <li>
                    <span class="combat">The large golem attacks <a href="party.html#Rasputin">Rasputin</a>, who manages to attack the golem in turn and sneak beyond it into an open doorway, then down a hallway.</span> </li>
                <li>
                    <span class="combat"><a href="party.html#Multimodal">Multimodal</a> summons a clan of eight badgers into the fray, rainbow colored fey spirits that sparkle brightly. They swarm one of the sentry bots, which attacks and kills one of the badgers in response. Bob tells <a href="party.html#L">"L"</a> via psychic link that there is some kind of motion going on. <a href="party.html#Zieg">Zieg</a> joins the fight and helps the badgers attack the sentry. <a href="party.html#Un-Kell">Ün-Kell</a>, confused after the shiny unicorn disappeared, takes his frustration out on a nearby sentry bot, destroying it. <a href="party.html#Nassirra">Nassirra</a> uses her thorns to slay another sentry bot.</span></li>
                <li>
                    <span class="combat"><a href="party.html#Rasputin">Rasputin</a> punches the golem, then continues running, and takes evasive action. The golem attacks and grapples him in response. <a href="party.html#Zieg">Zieg</a> tries to come to his aid, but is unable to prevent the golem's attack. <a href="party.html#L">"L"</a> hears the commotion and runs down the hallway, hexing the golem to make it less strong, then launches an Eldritch Blast at it. <a href="party.html#Zieg">Zieg</a> summons guardian spirits who attack the golem. <a href="party.html#Rasputin">Rasputin</a> takes one last attack at the golem and destroys it.</span></li>
                <li>
                    <span class="combat"><a href="party.html#Multimodal">Multimodal</a> takes a moment to collect herself, then launches another ice knife at a sentry, and the badgers assist her attacks. We kill the last of the sentry bots.</span></span></li>
            </ul>
            <li>
                <a href="party.html#Zieg">Zieg</a> asks <a href="party.html#L">"L"</a> about the hypnotic pattern he used earlier, and <a href="party.html#L">"L"</a> does not have a good explanation to give.</li>
            <li>During the fight, <a href="party.html#L">"L"</a> noticed a strange plaque in the pit. He presses it with <a href="npcs.html#Glasstaff">Glasstaff</a>'s staff and triggers a trap. Four bookcases spring up from the floor and reach the ceiling. <a href="party.html#Nassirra">Nassirra</a> manages to get out of the way in time, but one of the badgers gets stuck. <a href="party.html#Multimodal">Multimodal</a> heals it. The shelves contain crystalline substances, including lycealum crystals. </li>
            <li>
                <a href="party.html#Zieg">Zieg</a> investigates the hallway we fought the golem in, heading south. He finds a bugout bag near a desk that contains a healing potion, a ring, salted meats, and gold, including gold pieces that do not correspond to any currency <a href="party.html#Zieg">Zieg</a> knows of. They are made to look like reptilian scales of some kind. The signet ring has a similar scale on it.<li>
            <li>
                <a href="party.html#Rasputin">Rasputin</a> triggers another trap and a stone slab rises from the floor, but he gets out of the way in time. The trap makes a loud noise. Afterwards, <a href="party.html#Nassirra">Nassirra</a> hears footsteps in the house above them. She warns the rest of the group, and <a href="party.html#L">"L"</a> attempts to close the stairs, but is unable to. <a href="party.html#L">"L"</a> touches the stone slab with the staff, and it recedes into the floor. He then uses the staff to open a nearby door, which he and <a href="party.html#Rasputin">Rasputin</a> cautiously enter. It appears to be <a href="npcs.html#Glasstaff">Glasstaff</a>'s private office, filled with rare tomes.</li>
            <ul>
                <li>We open a book about the <a href="lore.html#The Eladrin">Eladrin</a>. We find familiar stories to what we had read previously, but we find <a href="npcs.html#Glasstaff">Glasstaff</a>'s handwritten notes in the margins. The notes suggest that he was paranoid about them for some reason.</li>
                <li>We read another book about the planes of existence, and learn that <a href="npcs.html#Glasstaff">Glasstaff</a> was obsessed with them, especially with elemental earth. We infer from this, and his golems, that he was some kind of stone-wielding sorcerer. The book mentions how to open portals between planes, including the repeated use of spells to weaken the barrier between planes at already weak points. From a book on the planar causeway, we learn that planes can even be made to coincide, if the veil is bent correctly. Another book documents planar pilgrimages, and we learn that the <a href="lore.html#The Eladrin">Eladrin</a> originally colonized the fey wild from another plane of existence, Arborea. Finally, a book about the veil is filled with nonsensical writings, as though the topic drove the write insane somehow. We glean from it that the veil is dangerous to sentient creatures. </li>
                
            </ul>
            <li>In addition to the literature in <a href="npcs.html#Glasstaff">Glasstaff</a>'s shelves, we find <a href="lore.html#Incriminating">incriminating documents.</a></li>
            <ul>
                <li>There is a letter that appears to be associated with the signet ring and scale coin we found earlier. We learn that the letter comes from someone among the Yuan-Ti, a wealthy and advanced society of snake-like humanoids.</li>
                <li>We learn that <a href="npcs.html#Glasstaff">Glasstaff</a> made some kind of bargain with the Scabfist Orcs, who appear to be tied to the mysterious psionics users we encountered.</li>
                <li>Another document shows evidence that Halia, who ran some kind of mining operation in Phandalin, was in league with some very bad people. We take note of this.</li>
                <li>We discuss potential leads from the documents. One mentions ruins south of Westport, which we suspect might be Thundertree. Another document we believe was written by Na'Zandar. Yet another may be from a necromancer. <a href="npcs.html#Glasstaff">Glasstaff</a> was in the shit with some seriously evil groups.</li>
                <li>Finally, we find a ledger listing 20 transactions that appears to document human traccking. It is carefully coded to anonymize buyers, sellers, and merchandise.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>We proceed down the hallway to the south, and we notice strange symbols on the ground that emanate abjuration magic. The symbol doesn't react to <a href="npcs.html#Glasstaff">Glasstaff</a>'s staff. <span class="combat"><a href="party.html#Un-Kell">Ün-Kell</a> rolls a barrel down the hallway, after which stone slabs shoot out of the floor and close off the hallway. Two golems and several golem bot sentries appear.</li>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <span class="combat"><a href="party.html#Zieg">Zieg</a> hurls a fireball at the golems which is effective, but also deals damage to nearby pillars holding up the ceiling. <a href="party.html#Nassirra">Nassirra</a> peaks out from behind a wall and attacks a golem, then resumes taking cover. <a href="party.html#Rasputin">Rasputin</a> tosses a force grenade down the hallway. <a href="party.html#L">"L"</a> hexes a golem and attacks with an Eldritch Blast. <a href="party.html#Un-Kell">Ün-Kell</a> swings to attack a golem, but misses. The sentry bots fire lasers at <a href="party.html#Un-Kell">Ün-Kell</a>, and the golems try to grapple him, but fail. <a href="party.html#Multimodal">Multimodal</a> heals <a href="party.html#Un-Kell">Ün-Kell</a>.</span></li>
                <li>
                    <span class="combat"><a href="party.html#Zieg">Zieg</a> shoots a ray of light at the golems. <a href="party.html#Nassirra">Nassirra</a> attempts to attack one of the golems, but misses. <a href="party.html#Rasputin">Rasputin</a> detonates the force grenade, dealing damage to the golems and sparing the pillars. The golems attack <a href="party.html#Rasputin">Rasputin</a> and <a href="party.html#Un-Kell">Ün-Kell</a>, but <a href="party.html#Multimodal">Multimodal</a> jumps in front of <a href="party.html#Un-Kell">Ün-Kell</a> with her shield, and <a href="party.html#Zieg">Zieg</a> fires a warding flare to protect <a href="party.html#Rasputin">Rasputin</a>, and the golems miss.</span></li>
                <li>
                    <span class="combat"><a href="party.html#L">"L"</a> fires another Eldritch Blast at a golem. <a href="party.html#Un-Kell">Ün-Kell</a> tries to attack a golem but misses. He then successfully grapples the golem and uses it as a shield. The sentry bots attack <a href="party.html#Un-Kell">Ün-Kell</a>, but he manages to divert most of the damage to the grappled golem. The other golem tries and fails to grapple <a href="party.html#Rasputin">Rasputin</a>. <a href="party.html#Multimodal">Multimodal</a> heals <a href="party.html#Un-Kell">Ün-Kell</a> again, and defends <a href="party.html#Rasputin">Rasputin</a> with her shield. <a href="party.html#Zieg">Zieg</a> shoots a ray of energy at the golem. <a href="party.html#Nassirra">Nassirra</a> strikes the killing blow on both of the golems. <a href="party.html#Rasputin">Rasputin</a> charges at two of the sentry bots and kill them. </span></li>
                <li>
                    <span class="combat"><a href="party.html#L">"L"</a> hexes one of the sentry bots and hurls an Eldrtich Blast toward it. <a href="party.html#Un-Kell">Ün-Kell</a>, hungry for revenge, kills one of the sentry bots and swings recklessly at another as it tries to run away. <a href="party.html#Multimodal">Multimodal</a> tosses an ice knife at it, killing it.</span> </span></li>
            </ul>
            <li>
                <a href="party.html#L">"L"</a> opens the stone blockage with his staff, and we discover a narrow, descending tunnel. Bob scouts ahead and flies out of range. When <a href="party.html#L">"L"</a> calls him back, he reports that the tunnel continues for a long time. We decide to follow it.</li>
        </ul>
    </ul>
</ul>

<h3 id="The Beginning is the End">The Beginning is the End and the End is the Beginning</h3>

<ul>
    <li>As we traverse the tunnel, <a href="party.html#Nassirra">Nassirra</a> can tell from the angle and direction of descent that the tunnel leads toward the palace. <a href="party.html#Multimodal">Multimodal</a> uses wild shape to transform into a giant badger and claws to the surface to see exactly what the tunnel is under. She sees the palace gardens, and returns to the group to report back in her firbolg form. We proceed until we reach the end of the tunnel, where we encounter a flat wall with symbols on it, much like the symbols we encountered in the southern hallway of <a href="npcs.html#Glasstaff">Glasstaff</a>'s secret lair. <a href="party.html#L">"L"</a> touches it with his staff and reveals steps covered in grass. We determine that the steps lead to the castle.</li>
    <ul>
        <li>As we surface from the steps, <a href="party.html#Nassirra">Nassirra</a> casts pass without trace to mask our steps. <a href="party.html#Nassirra">Nassirra</a> then explores. She sees the garden, the palace walls with a light at the top, and a nearby house. She approaches the house and peeks into a window. There are no lights on, but she can see that the house is extravagant and must its occupant must be someone of high status. <a href="party.html#Nassirra">Nassirra</a> returns to the group and tells us she's going to investigate elsewhere, then returns to rob the joint.</li>
        <li>
            <a href="party.html#Nassirra">Nassirra</a> sneaks into the kitchen through the window. She sees very fancy appliances powered by magic. Suddenly she notices candlelight from an adjacent room, as someone makes their way to the kitchen.</span>
</li>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <span id="02/09/2020"><a href="party.html#Nassirra">Nassirra</a> discovers that the residence belongs to the Hallwinters (<a href="npcs.html#Sildar">Sildar</a>'s family). She doesn't let that stop her from pocketing a few trinkets. Someone notices her presence in the mansion and alerts the guards. She bails. </li>
        </ul>
        <li>As the rest of the party waits for <a href="party.html#Nassirra">Nassirra</a> to return, <a href="party.html#L">"L"</a> sends Bob out to scout. <a href="party.html#Rasputin">Rasputin</a> gets restless, and hears footsteps in the grass. Bob sees the source fo the footsteps, a servant from the mansion. As <a href="party.html#L">"L"</a> silently relays this information to the group, the servant begins yelling about an intruder in the mansion, alerting the guards.</li>
        <li>At the same time, <a href="party.html#Nassirra">Nassirra</a> escapes the mansion from a window and runs across rooftops toward the west to escape. A knight jumps down from the window in pursuit. The rest of the party realizes that we need to create a distraction to help <a href="party.html#Nassirra">Nassirra</a> escape, and to get ourselves out of a very bad position.</li>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <a href="party.html#Rasputin">Rasputin</a> throws a ball bearing at the roof to make a distracting noise. Bob moos loudly and creepily, drawing the attention of the guards. <a href="party.html#Zieg">Zieg</a> creates a fog cloud to obscure the guards' line of sight on <a href="party.html#Nassirra">Nassirra</a>. <a href="party.html#Multimodal">Multimodal</a> turns into a large cow and  <a href="party.html#L">"L"</a> magically grants her the ability to fly. The servant cries out about Bob's moo, drawing attention to Bob, so <a href="party.html#Multimodal">Multimodal</a> the cow also begins mooing intimidatingly. <a href="party.html#L">"L"</a> creates a minor illusion of fire behind  <a href="party.html#Multimodal">Multimodal</a> to complete the paranormal picture. </li> 
            <li>The diversion succeeds. <a href="party.html#Nassirra">Nassirra</a> is able to rejoin the group in the tunnel safely. We decide our best strategy is to head east and try to navigate out of the Palace District through the gardens. <a href="party.html#L">"L"</a> attemps to close off the tunnel passage before we make a run for it, but is unable to intuit the correct method to do so, and decides to bail instead. As the rest of the group approaches the eastern hedge, <a href="party.html#Multimodal">Multimodal</a> returns to her firbolg form and uses firbolg magic to briefly turn invisible so that she can rejoin the others without giving away their position. <a href="party.html#Multimodal">Multimodal</a> and Bob fly over the hedge to escape, and the rest of the party is able to vault over the hedges without incident. As we clear the hedges, we hear the guards take notice of the tunnel entrance.</li>
            <li>The group heads south as night falls to escape the palace gardens, taking care to avoid patrolling guards. In spite of our attempt to sneak quietly, <a href="party.html#Zieg">Zieg</a>'s armor rattles, and a guard takes notice. The guard calls out to others, coming from the north. <a href="party.html#L">"L"</a> creates a minor illusion of another guard calling out "They're over here!" to our northwest, the direction we came from, to lure the guards away from us. The trick works. </li>
            <li>We make it to the far east wall which is 20 feet high. <a href="party.html#L">"L"</a> sends Bob to make sure the coast is clear. <a href="party.html#Nassirra">Nassirra</a> climbs up the wall and secures a rope on a jutting fixture. <a href="party.html#Rasputin">Rasputin</a> scales the wall with the help of a grappling hook and lets down a rope for others to climb up. We land in someone's backyard in the Aurora District, then quietly head to a nearby alley. <a href="party.html#Rasputin">Rasputin</a> asks <a href="party.html#Nassirra">Nassirra</a> what she grabbed from the manor, and whether it was worth all the subsequent ruckus. She reveals a set of wedding rings, a plaque, and a ninja star with magical powers. The plaque has "Reginald Hallwinter III" on the inscription. We note as a group that it can't be an accident that the tunnel led from <a href="npcs.html#Glasstaff">Glasstaff</a>'s house to the Hallwinters' residence, which casts some suspicion on <a href="npcs.html#Sildar">Sildar</a>'s family, and possibly on <a href="npcs.html#Sildar">Sildar</a> himself.</li>
        </ul>
        <li>We are tired from the battle and from escaping the palace gardens. We decide to stop at an inn. A passerby tells us about the Starlight Respite inn in the Aurora District, but tells us condescendingly that it is expensive, and we get the feeling we would stand out too much there. Instead, we proceed to the Sundial District and stay at an inn we had not visited previously. It's packed with refugees from Lilygrove. <a href="party.html#L">"L"</a> identifies the magical star <a href="party.html#Nassirra">Nassirra</a> scored, which she trades with <a href="party.html#Rasputin">Rasputin</a> in exchange for his Sash of Treant Vigor. <a href="party.html#Rasputin">Rasputin</a> is broke as a joke, so the rest of us pay for his food and lodging. We rest for the night.
        </li>
    </ul>
</ul>

<h3 id="Reverence Day">Reverence Day</h3>

<ul>
    <li>We awake to discover that Reverence Day has arrived. The holiday celebrates the coming of spring and the wind spirits. Tensions are high in Elspire with the refugee crisis, but there is celebration nevertheless. Decorations are up around the city and residents put out baskets of offerings for the wind spirits. If the spirits visit the baskets and take food, it is considered a good omen for the year to come. <a href="party.html#Un-Kell">Ün-Kell</a> does not understand the tradition but he does understand the concept of free food, and proceeds to graze from the offerings. We recall briefly that we were invited to return to Phandalin for a festival celebrating Reverence Day, but we find our care cups to be empty where the subject is concerned. </li>
    <li>Near the east gate exiting the city, we notice that a queue has formed. The lockdown post-assassination attempt has been lifted, though there is tight security to leave. We decide to check down at the docks to see whether ships are allowed to leave as well, and perhaps to find our captain, Jaina. <a href="party.html#L">"L"</a> forges a mercenary recruitment document from the Silver Scabbard to help us get out of town, just in case.</li>
    <ul>
        <li>As we head to the River District, we try to eavesdrop on conversations to see whether word has spread about <a href="party.html#Nassirra">Nassirra</a>'s burglary. She doesn't detect anything, not even in thieves' cant. We do hear that a sinkhole opened up in the Palace District, and realize that was our doing.
        </li>
        <li>When we arrive in the River District, we get some weird looks, though probably just because we're a group of non-humans. We look for Jaina and manage to spot her boat. There's a large group of people queuing to exit by boat, just as there were at the east gate. We notice that Jaina and her crew are trying to leave themselves. <a href="party.html#Zieg">Zieg</a> sends a message telepathically to Jaina to let her know that we're still interested in leaving the city with her. She responds telepathically and tells us to come to her ship. </li>
        <li>
            <a href="party.html#Rasputin">Rasputin</a> and <a href="party.html#L">"L"</a> approach the guards. <a href="party.html#L">"L"</a> presents the forged document as a reason for our travel. The guards are skeptical but ultimately seem convinced that the bounty is real and that it's plausible for the guild to dispatch us to take care of it. Jaina vouches for us with the guards as well. Before we board, the guards search each of us.
        </li>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <a href="party.html#Rasputin">Rasputin</a> carefully hides the stolen ninja star in his robe. The guards find lots of silver forks in <a href="party.html#Rasputin">Rasputin</a>'s bag from <a href="npcs.html#Glasstaff">Glasstaff</a>'s house. <a href="party.html#L">"L"</a> convinces them that monks use forks to fight, and the guards allow <a href="party.html#Rasputin">Rasputin</a> to pass.</li>
            <li>On searching <a href="party.html#Nassirra">Nassirra</a>, the guards finds the signet ring we found in <a href="npcs.html#Glasstaff">Glasstaff</a>'s house, which they consider suspicious but ultimately decide is ok.</li>
            <li>
                <a href="party.html#Un-Kell">Ün-Kell</a>'s disguise kit raises the guards' suspicions but he is able to successfully convince them that it's a sex thing.</li>
        </ul>
        <li>We all pass security inspection and board the boat.</li>
    </ul>

</ul>

<h2 id="The Hollows">To the Hollows</h2>
<ul>
    <li>We discover that the boat is piloted by a dwarf using magical powers to propoel the boat through the water. <a href="party.html#L">"L"</a> recognizes this ability as storm sorcery, which certain folk who have a special connection to the weather are able to use.
    </li>
    <li>We pay Jaina the rest of what we owe her for our passage. She confirms that we will stick to the original plan, in which she will drop us off before the boat's ultimate destination. We camp on shore overnight in the interest of safety, then resume the next day.</li>
    <li>The other passengers are all strangers to us. There is a Goliath woman who seems to be possibly interested in <a href="party.html#Un-Kell">Ün-Kell</a>. He tries to court her, dousing himself in perfume, and ultimately commits sexual assault. She demands he get kicked off the boat but he doesn't because patriarchy. Thanks to his actions, we get a reputation on board as troublemakers.</li>
    <li>We disembark at the agreed upon point, and Jaina makes it clear that she is happy to be rid of us. </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="Breaking Rocks All Day">Breaking Rocks All Day</h3>

<ul>
    <li>We head north along the road. We note a change in terrain, from smooth foothills to jagged snowcapped mountains. The ground is gray, less brown, and there is little vegetation. We come upon Ashmore, a small mining town between the riverlands and the hollows. There is a large pit to the north, off to the left if approaching from the south. In the pit there is a shanty town of sorts, temporary structures where dwarves smelt ore. There are rows of houses, some stores, inns and taverns. There is no celebration of Revenence Day here. We see some ashen folk who likely fled Lilygrove. <a href="party.html#Zieg">Zieg</a> covers up his holy signs.</li>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <a href="party.html#Rasputin">Rasputin</a> approaches one of the dwarves and asks why the miners are working so hard on a holiday. The miner says they're working overtime as a point of pride to meet the demand for steel from the capital city (Elspire). <a href="party.html#Rasputin">Rasputin</a> suggests it might be related to the orc incursion in the south driving demand for weapons.</li>
        <li>
            <a href="party.html#Rasputin">Rasputin</a> asks the miner to recommend an inn, and he suggests the Iron Cast Bones inn. <a href="party.html#Rasputin">Rasputin</a> asks who is in charge of the mining operation as well, and learns that Beryl Bronzebeard is in charge of the operation. <a href="party.html#Rasputin">Rasputin</a> also asks the miner whether he knows Halia, recalling the damning note we found implicating her in <a href="npcs.html#Glasstaff">Glasstaff</a>'s dirty work, but the miner is unfamiliar.</li>
    </ul>
    <li>
        <a href="party.html#Multimodal">Multimodal</a> looks sadly at the ground and encourages plants to grow temporarily. <a href="party.html#Zieg">Zieg</a> asks whether the land is barren due to natural reasons or something unnatural. <a href="party.html#Multimodal">Multimodal</a> gets the sense that the mining operation has contaminated the earth, but also that something nefarious has plagued these lands for a long time, sapping life from the ground.</li>
    <li>We all enter the tavern together. After we've gotten situated, a cloaked figure stumbles into the tavern, clearly injured, an arm held tightly to their chest. <a href="party.html#Multimodal">Multimodal</a> and <a href="party.html#Zieg">Zieg</a> detect a faint glint of a chin with silver scales under the hood of the cloak. The figure heads to the bar, and <a href="party.html#Zieg">Zieg</a> follows. The figure orders a drink in a familiar voice. <a href="party.html#Zieg">Zieg</a> orders the same and tells the bartender that the figure's drink is on him. The figure turns to <a href="party.html#Zieg">Zieg</a> and reaveals himself as <a href="npcs.html#Razak">Razak</a>, injured but still alive.</span></li>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <span id="03/08/2020"><a href="party.html#Zieg">Zieg</a> notices that <a href="npcs.html#Razak">Razak</a> is no longer wearing his armor, and is obviously injured. He asks <a href="npcs.html#Razak">Razak</a> if we can speak to him in private, and we go upstairs to our room with him. <a href="party.html#Un-Kell">Ün-Kell</a> keeps watch outside the door, and <a href="party.html#Nassirra">Nassirra</a> keeps watch downstairs.</li>
        <li>Once in the room, <a href="npcs.html#Razak">Razak</a> sits on a bed, and <a href="party.html#Zieg">Zieg</a> examines his wounds. He sees evidence of recent bleeding from wounds that are not new, but are not staying closed on their own. He communes with Pelor to aid <a href="npcs.html#Razak">Razak</a>'s recovery. </li>
        <li>
            <a href="party.html#Zieg">Zieg</a> also notices that <a href="party.html#L">"L"</a> is sweating profusely and looks ill. <a href="party.html#Multimodal">Multimodal</a> offers to examine him, but <a href="party.html#L">"L"</a> refuses the help.</li>
         <li>
            <a href="npcs.html#Razak">Razak</a> tells us that he is trying to get back to Elspire. He has some sense of urgency, but does not divulge a specific reason. We tell him about the assassination attempt on the King, which only heightens his sense of urgency. </li>
         <li>
            <a href="party.html#Rasputin">Rasputin</a> asks <a href="npcs.html#Razak">Razak</a> what happened at Elk's Crossing, and why he traveled so far north if he wants to return west to Elspire. </li>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <a href="npcs.html#Razak">Razak</a> says Elk's Crossing was horrified. He encountered the psionic orcs that we encountered, and says they not only levitated his soldiers, but tore them apart. During the fight, he recalls someone plunging a blade into his neck, and he has the wound to prove it. He thought he was going to die. Instead, he was able to shed his gear, get to the river, and float east until one of the fisherfolk saved him.</li>
                <li>
                    <a href="party.html#Rasputin">Rasputin</a> asks whether he was saved by a human, knowing full well from Dr. Cloudy's scrying that it was a half-orc, in order to test <a href="npcs.html#Razak">Razak</a>'s honesty. <a href="npcs.html#Razak">Razak</a> volunteers that he was saved by a half-orc. He says he came to Ashmore because he needed to rest, and it was the closest town he knew of that was not in the path of battle.</li>
                <li>Something feels a bit off to<a href="party.html#Rasputin">Rasputin</a>. Given our current fears about necromancy, he worries that perhaps <a href="npcs.html#Razak">Razak</a> did not survive the battle truly, or perhaps he is under someone else's control.</li>
            </ul>
        <li>We rest for the night and wake to the start of a new month, Bennens. We recall that the court of Elspire summoned us to appear in but a few days. <a href="party.html#Zieg">Zieg</a> wakes <a href="npcs.html#Razak">Razak</a> and asks for permission to inspect him further and determine that nothing strange is going on, to which <a href="npcs.html#Razak">Razak</a> agrees. <a href="party.html#Zieg">Zieg</a> communes with Pelor to sense evil forces in the vicinity, but none emanate from <a href="npcs.html#Razak">Razak</a>. <a href="party.html#Multimodal">Multimodal</a> uses her Firbolg magic to sense any magical auras that mind-controlling magics might emit, and finds none. <a href="party.html#L">"L"</a> performs a ritual to understand languages he otherwise cannot speak, and translates <a href="npcs.html#Razak">Razak</a>'s last name, Guldarzadarian, from draconic to common (it means "one who eats the sun and gold"). <a href="npcs.html#Razak">Razak</a> confirms his translation and seems confused.</li>
        <li>
            <a href="npcs.html#Razak">Razak</a> announces that he is ravenous, and we go downstairs to eat breakfast. </li>
        <ul>
            <li>As we eat, we ask him why he wants to return to Elspire so badly, and why he didn't go back to Triboar after his defeat at Elk's Crossing. He explains that he had no safe path back to Triboar from the battle, and could only head toward the river safely, which then brought him east. <a href="party.html#L">"L"</a> senses that <a href="npcs.html#Razak">Razak</a> feels great shame over his loss, and is guarded as a result.</li>
            <li>
                <a href="npcs.html#Razak">Razak</a> tells us he wants to go back to Elspire because he fears he is needed, as a member of the Lord's Round. His sense of duty was only strengthened by the news of the attempted regicide. We can see his resolve is unshakeable. <a href="party.html#Un-Kell">Ün-Kell</a> returns the lawblade to him, and he smiles. </li>
            <li>
                <a href="party.html#Rasputin">Rasputin</a> asks whether <a href="npcs.html#Razak">Razak</a> has the authority to move our court date. We explain that we were summoned to testify on the matter of <a href="npcs.html#Glasstaff">Glasstaff</a>'s posthumous criminal trial, but that we have concerns that a larger conspiracy may be at play and we may be falsely accused of something that we don't have the power or reputation to contest. </li>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <a href="party.html#Rasputin">Rasputin</a> tells him about <a href="npcs.html#Glasstaff">Glasstaff</a>'s secret golemancy laboratory, and what we found there. <a href="npcs.html#Razak">Razak</a>'s first reaction is to tell us how stupid it was for us to break into <a href="npcs.html#Glasstaff">Glasstaff</a>'s home. We then explain that we went there to investigate a possible connection to the assassin, and to find evidence that might protect us from wrongful conviction. We turn over the incriminating letters we confiscated from his office. <a href="npcs.html#Razak">Razak</a> reads them over, then puts them away. He believes us, and believes in truth over his political allegiances, but he warns us that he may come for us and, if he does so, it would be for our own protection. Better him than someone else.</li>
            </ul>
        </ul>
    <li>We give <a href="npcs.html#Razak">Razak</a> some supplies to help him on his return to Elspire. <a href="party.html#Zieg">Zieg</a> gives him some gold and a magical item that can help protect him. <a href="party.html#Multimodal">Multimodal</a> gives him the wooden shield she set out with when she left home. We bid him luck, and then say farewell.</li>
    </ul>
</ul>

<h3 id="To the Valley of the Shadow of Death">To the Valley of the Shadow of Death</h3>
<ul>
    <li>
        <a href="party.html#Rasputin">Rasputin</a> asks the innkeep, a woman who was not working the night before, whether we can buy a map of the area anywhere. She tells us there are no cartographers in Ashmore, but she can give us directions if there's somewhere we'd like to do. <a href="party.html#L">"L"</a> pulls out some paper and draws a rough map based on her directions. She tells us Lucav is about half a day's travel from Ashmore, taking the westward road from Lilygrove, but urges us not to head that direction for our own safety. <a href="party.html#Zieg">Zieg</a> pays her well for the information, and her discertion. 
    </li>
    <li>As we lave the inn, we notice that a dense, ominous fog has beset the town, but we hear no foul music on the air that the refugees from Lilygrove told us about. We head north. The plants we encounter are all dried husks, and it is eerily quiet. The air gets wetter and the fog more dense, until we can only see 20 feet ahead. The trail gets more worn, and then turns to cobblestone, as we approach a town. <a href="party.html#Zieg">Zieg</a> tries to light the way with Dawnbringer, but the fog is too thick, and the light reflects off of it, so he extinguishes it.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="Lily of the Valley">Lily of the Valley</h3>


<ul>
    <li>We come upon an abandoned stable and <a href="party.html#Rasputin">Rasputin</a> looks around. He sees heavy hoofprints from frantic horses, humanoid footprints leaving the stable, and a blood trail. He follows the blood, parallel to the road, and encounters more cobblestones around a tall building. The sign above the door reads "Lily's Grace". It appears to be an inn. <a href="party.html#Zieg">Zieg</a> asks Pelor to protect <a href="party.html#Un-Kell">Ün-Kell</a> from the forces of evil, and the three of them enter the inn.</li>   
    <ul> 
        <li>It is dark in the inn, but there is less fog in the air, so <a href="party.html#Zieg">Zieg</a> lights Dawnbringer. <a href="party.html#Rasputin">Rasputin</a> sees a still figure on the other side of a table. He makes a noise, and the figure slowly rises, then groans. He immediately recognizes the sound of undeath.</li>
        <li>
            <span class="combat"><a href="party.html#Rasputin">Rasputin</a> charges at the zombie and throws his newly-acquired ninja star at it. It snaps back to him, and he repeats until the zombie is decapitated. <a href="party.html#Rasputin">Rasputin</a> heads to eh bar, and whistles to alert members of the party outside the inn. In the process, he draws two zombies out of a store room behind the bar. <a href="party.html#L">"L"</a> is still outside and doesn't see anything, but he notices a haunting tune on the air. He alerts <a href="party.html#Multimodal">Multimodal</a> and <a href="party.html#Nassirra">Nassirra</a>, then heads inside the inn. <a href="party.html#Nassirra">Nassirra</a> follows and readies her long bow. <a href="party.html#Zieg">Zieg</a> runs to <a href="party.html#Rasputin">Rasputin</a>'s aid and summon's Pelor's flame to attack the undead. <a href="party.html#Un-Kell">Ün-Kell</a> rushes into the inn, hurls a javelin at a zombie, killing it. <a href="party.html#Multimodal">Multimodal</a> imbues <a href="party.html#Nassirra">Nassirra</a>'s arrows with the elemental power of fire. As more zombies approach, she fires an arrow, but misses. <a href="party.html#L">"L"</a> attempts to electrify a zombie, but the electricity is weak.</span></li>
        <li>
            <span class="combat"><a href="party.html#Rasputin">Rasputin</a> jumps on the bar and hurls his throwing star at two zombies, killing one of them. <a href="party.html#L">"L"</a> regains his magical energies and successfully shocks a nearby zombie, but it does not die. He backs away from it. <a href="party.html#Nassirra">Nassirra</a> managed to kill another zombie, clearing the room temporarily. <a href="party.html#Un-Kell">Ün-Kell</a> approaches a stairwell going up and hears scratching sounds coming from the roof. <a href="party.html#Multimodal">Multimodal</a> grabs a nearby table and tries to barricade the door, but she is not strong enough to do it herself. She calls out for <a href="party.html#Un-Kell">Ün-Kell</a> to help. Before he can get to her, three more zombies storm the door.</span></li>
        <li>
            <span class="combat"><a href="party.html#Rasputin">Rasputin</a> and <a href="party.html#Zieg">Zieg</a> turn their attention to the incoming zombies, <a href="party.html#Rasputin">Rasputin</a> hurling his ninja star and <a href="party.html#Zieg">Zieg</a> attacking with radiant light. <a href="party.html#L">"L"</a> utters a curse at one of the zombies and then hurls a series of Eldritch blasts at it, killing it. <a href="party.html#Nassirra">Nassirra</a> jumps up on the bar, chooses a target, and killing it with a fiery arrow. With a flip through the air, she jumps to the other side of the bar to shoot another zombie trying to get into the inn, but misses. <a href="party.html#Zieg">Zieg</a> gets behind her and summons a sacred flame upon the zombies at the door, but they are unharmed. <a href="party.html#Un-Kell">Ün-Kell</a> helps <a href="party.html#Multimodal">Multimodal</a> barricade the door. </span> We take a moment to take inventory of our weapons and strategize our defenses, but it is shortlived. <span class="combat">After just a few moments, the zombies break through the barricade and pour into the inn. Three of them swarm <a href="party.html#Multimodal">Multimodal</a>, biting her flesh. Zombies bang against a window near the stairwell, and <a href="party.html#L">"L"</a> can tell it will not hold for long. </span></li>
        <li>
            <span class="combat"><a href="party.html#Rasputin">Rasputin</a> tosses a force egg into a group of zombies near the entrance to the inn, and calls out for us to take cover. <a href="party.html#L">"L"</a> incinerates one zombie with an Eldritch blast, but others burst in through the window. <a href="party.html#Nassirra">Nassirra</a> shoots and kills another zombie, then positions herself on the bar where she can see cover all entry points. <a href="party.html#Zieg">Zieg</a> glows with the light of Pelor, empowering his allies' attacks. <a href="party.html#Un-Kell">Ün-Kell</a> becomes enraged and, with his newfound strength, swings his blade at two zombies and kills them both. <a href="party.html#Multimodal">Multimodal</a> launches an ice knife at the zombies crowding the door, but it does not kill them. In retaliation, they pin her down. </span></li>
        <li>
            <span class="combat"><a href="party.html#Rasputin">Rasputin</a>'s force egg detonates. He uses his training in the long death to horrify several of the zombies, then punches one into natural death. A large group of zombies has broken through the window near the stairs. <a href="party.html#L">"L"</a> decides to incinerate them with a powerful fireball. As flames engulf the room, <a href="party.html#Multimodal">Multimodal</a> raises her shield from the ground and envelopes <a href="party.html#Nassirra">Nassirra</a> in a protective barrier that prevents her from getting burned. <a href="party.html#Nassirra">Nassirra</a> directs her attention toward a particularly agile zombie that evaded the fireball and puts it down with two shots. <a href="party.html#Zieg">Zieg</a> fires a scorching beam of energy at several of the zombies, wounding them, but none of them die. An agile zombie crawls through the window and, with a mighty swing of his blade, <a href="party.html#Un-Kell">Ün-Kell</a> destroys it. <a href="party.html#Multimodal">Multimodal</a> directs a wave of radiant energy at the zombie still gnawing on her, killing it. As more zombies charge in the doorway, <a href="party.html#Rasputin">Rasputin</a> and <a href="party.html#Un-Kell">Ün-Kell</a> strike them, but they manage to attack <a href="party.html#Multimodal">Multimodal</a> anyway. </span></li>
        <li>
            <span class="combat"><a href="party.html#Rasputin">Rasputin</a> attacks the zombie gnawing on <a href="party.html#Multimodal">Multimodal</a>. <a href="party.html#L">"L"</a> slays another agile zombie with a barrage of Eldritch blasts. <a href="party.html#Nassirra">Nassirra</a> lands the killing blow on the zombie attacking <a href="party.html#Multimodal">Multimodal</a>. <a href="party.html#Zieg">Zieg</a> charges into a group of zombies and emits a field of radiant energy that kills two of them. <a href="party.html#Un-Kell">Ün-Kell</a> kills the remaining two zombies.</span></li>
    </ul> 
    <li>We collect ourselves and decide to explore the rest of the town. As we exit the inn, we see a village square open up before us, strewn with abandoned textiles and jewelry, and some abandoned food, most of which is spoiled. The fog is still too thick to see much. We spot a clock tower, climb up to the top, and take a brief rest once we are safely off the ground. Once we've caught out breath, we descend and resume our investigation.</li>
    <ul>
        <li>We find dead bodies of Lilygrove citizens that have clearly been chewed on, and dead bodies of zombies. When we examine the corpses of the weaker zombies, we see they are infested with writhing worms. <a href="party.html#Multimodal">Multimodal</a> senses that these zombies were not animated by magical means, but by some other force. We decide to burn them, along with the other dead bodies.</li>
        <li>We notice that there are very few children among the dead, fewer than one would expect for a town the size of Lilygrove. We also note that there were far more zombies than there were chewed bodies, as though the zombies did not originate here, but descended on the town from elsewhere. We wonder whether the children were trafficked, and recall the letter to <a href="npcs.html#Glasstaff">Glasstaff</a> with a necromantic aura about it.</li>
    </ul>
    <li>We scavenge what supplies we can from Lilygrove and press on to Lucav by the westward road. As time goes on, <a href="party.html#L">"L"</a> becomes visibly ill, even worse than he was in Ashmore. We take notice and ask if he needs to stop. He isn't sure he can make it, but insists we continue. <a href="party.html#Zieg">Zieg</a> walks with him to support his weight if needed. </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="Lucav">Lucav</h2>
<ul>
    <li>We appraoch Lucav, a city surrounded by a stone wall, and are hailed by a guard who asks what business brings us to Lucav. <a href="party.html#Zieg">Zieg</a> speaks up and tells them that we are travelers from the south. They let us in with only a touch of skepticism. The guard tells us we can seek lodging in an inn called the sink, located in a place called the basin, which he tells us is very bad but does have beds. He also tells us that we should not have come.</li>
    <ul>
        <li>As we enter the town, we notice the worn-out faces of the townsfolk. They seem both fearful and defeated, and there is an overwhelming sense of dread in the air. <a href="party.html#L">"L"</a> feels better and shares that with the group. <a href="party.html#Nassirra">Nassirra</a> makes it clear that she doesn't care and does not trust him, brushing her whiskers singed by his fireball.</li>
        <li>When we enter the basin, we discover that the ground is very soggy. We head to the Sink and notice along the way that there are heavily armored guards patrolling the town. The walls appear to be strong, and the people seem to be protected, despite their fear. Something feels strange about it. We notice that there don't seem to be an unusual number of children in town.</li>
        <li>We arrive at the sink and are greeted by the stench of stagnant water. There are customers in the inn who seem just as scared and jaded as the townsfolk outside, each with a thousand yard stare. </li>
        <ul>
            <li>The innkeep greets us and asks if we require lodging. We pay a suspiciously low rate for food and beds. He asks why we've come to Lucav, and we decide to feign naivety. He falls for it hook, line, and sinker, and begins to tell us about the history of Lucav.</span></li>

                <li>
                    <span id="04/11/2020"> He introduces himself as Jaedyn, and asks how much we know about the second age. We don't know very much. He tells us that there was much bloodshed during the wars, and (presumably) as a result, the land is cursed.</li>
                <li>We ask Jaedyn about the Lucavi knights, and while he is hesitant to go into specific details, he's more forthcoming than we might have expected. He says the Lucavi knights keep the town safe, but alludes to some moral gray area in the operation. He also tells us about their famed weapons, light blades, that are especially effective against the undead. Members of the Lucavi come from noble houses and are 3rd or later in line to inherit lands or titles, so instead they decide to make a name for themselves fighting the undead. He tells us that they are led by the Champion <a href="npcs.html#Kont">Kont</a>, who is a paladin. He warns us not to get in the way of the Lucavi, or to poke around where we don't belong.</li>
                <li>We ask why The Sink smells like its namesake. He explains that it's difficult to keep buildings dry in the basin, because of how soggy the land is. He also tells us that fog tends to collect in the basin.</li>
                <li>We also ask him about the House of Records. He explains that it's essentially a library and some parts are open to the public, but others are only accessible to the priests of Zivilyn.</li>
                <li>We ask whether he's heard anything about a necromancer in the area. He's heard no such thing, but tells us that the dead usually come from the foothills.</li>
                <li>Jaedyn points us to various points of interest in town, including a general goods store, an armory (called Shield), the Bethla house (where the mayor resides), the barracks, Dorter's Porters (a.k.a the debauchery house), and the Riovannes House, which is afflicated by an infestation of some kind.</li>
                <li>
                    <a href="party.html#Rasputin">Rasputin</a> asks whether Jaedyn knows anyone in town who sells goods that aren't exactly on the up-and-up. He doesn't give any leads.</li>
                <li>A server emerges from the kitchen and presents gray, sad-looking food to us. Multimodal uses a druidic spell to purify it before we eat. It tastes like ash in our mouths.</li>
                <li>Before we retire to our room, we pay Jaedyn a bit extra for his discretion about our conversation.</li>
            </ul>
        </ul>
        <li>
            <a href="party.html#Zieg">Zieg</a> takes a moment before resting for the night to check in with some of our far-away friends by way of sending. He asks <a href="npcs.html#Razak">Razak</a> what he knows about Champion <a href="npcs.html#Kont">Kont</a>, and Razak tells him that <a href="npcs.html#Kont">Kont</a> is powerful and well-respected. <a href="party.html#Zieg">Zieg</a> checks in with Miranda to see how she fared after evacuating Triboar. She says she and the others made it to Phandalin, which has fallen prey to a dragon. The rest of her response is cut off. Finally, <a href="party.html#Zieg">Zieg</a> sends a message to <a href="party.html#Un-Kell">Ün-Kell</a>'s father, Vaurek, asking how his escape from Elspire went. Vaurek says he and the mysterious duo he escaped with were attacked by cultists once again, are now in the woods, and are heading to the temple. <a href="party.html#Zieg">Zieg</a> doesn't know which temple he means.</li>
    </ul>
    <li>In the morning, <a href="party.html#Zieg">Zieg</a> decides to go to the town square and give a sermon to inspire hope in the citizens of Lucav. In the town square there is a fountain that has gone dry, and the remnants of a podium that has been disassembled. The basin is beset by a morning fog. Nevertheless, <a href="party.html#Zieg">Zieg</a> carries on. He tells them not to fear, for Pelor's light will guide them out of the darkness. <a href="party.html#Multimodal">Multimodal</a> and <a href="party.html#Nassirra">Nassirra</a> stand amongst the crowd to see how the citizens and the Lucavi alike react.</li>
    <ul>
        <li>A crowd of a dozen or so citizens forms around <a href="party.html#Zieg">Zieg</a> as he tells them the good news about Pelor. Lucavi knights appear to take notice as well, but they don't intervene. An older woman approaches <a href="party.html#Zieg">Zieg</a> after he is done to thank him for his words.</li>
        <li>The Lucavi who took notice also approach <a href="party.html#Zieg">Zieg</a> after his sermon is complete. They ask his name, and his purpose in Lucav. <a href="party.html#Zieg">Zieg</a> tells them about the call to arms we received (through <a href="party.html#L">"L"</a> and the Silver Scabbard) and that our adventuring party came to answer the call. <a href="party.html#Zieg">Zieg</a> notices that they are well-equipped, and remarks on the rumors he's heard about their lightblades. They appear a bit guarded at first, but ultimately admit they could use more help. The senior Lucavi introduces herself as Lucia. She suggests that <a href="party.html#Zieg">Zieg</a> talk to Champion <a href="npcs.html#Kont">Kont</a> about how we might be able to help. She tells him that he is currently out on a scouting mission, and will need to rest after the scouting party returns. She advises we wait several hours after they return before going to the Bastion, and to tell the guards that Lucia sent us.</li>
    </ul>
</ul>
<h3 id="The House of the Rising Mold">The House of the Rising Mold</h3>
<ul>
    <li>While <a href="party.html#Zieg">Zieg</a> gives his sermon, <a href="party.html#Rasputin">Rasputin</a> decides to investigate the Riovannes House. A guard in a tower stopped him from getting too close, by order of Champion. When <a href="party.html#Rasputin">Rasputin</a> asks for information about the building, tossing a few silver pieces up to the guard to get it, the guard explains that it was once an asylum. <a href="party.html#Rasputin">Rasputin</a> suspects that it's now overrun by the undead.</li>
    <li>We regroup at The Sink. <a href="party.html#L">"L"</a>, <a href="party.html#Nassirra">Nassirra</a>, <a href="party.html#Rasputin">Rasputin</a> and <a href="party.html#Un-Kell">Ün-Kell</a> decide to go to Dorter's Porters. <a href="party.html#L">"L"</a> is still recovering from his sudden illness en route to Lucav, but <a href="party.html#Nassirra">Nassirra</a> convinces him that some debauchery will help him feel better. <a href="party.html#Zieg">Zieg</a> wants no part of it, and does not want to know about any ill deeds that might take place there.</li> 
    <ul>
        <li>The group attempts to look inconspicuous as they enter, covering up their weapons. <a href="party.html#Nassirra">Nassirra</a> approaches a dwarf running the bar, and speaks in thieves' cant to get information discretely.</li>
        <ul>
            <li>She asks him about the Riovannes House. He communicates (indirectly) that no one is allowed in the building anymore, that it was once well-respected, but no longer is. It was once a beautiful place where those who were sick entered and some emerged well again, but other times there was grief and loss.</li>
            <li>She asks about the Lucavi. He suggests that they are all around, and alluded to constant surveillance such that he does not feel safe saying anything. To save face and set him at ease, she says she was interested in the history of the group, but moves on to another subject.</li>
            <li>She asks about the House of Record. He clearly has experience with other members (or prospective members?) of The Eye, and knows exactly what she's after. He tells her it will be difficult to obtain what she seeks.</li>
            <li>Finally, she asks whether he has any black market goods for sale, and he affirms that he does. <a href="party.html#Nassirra">Nassirra</a> beckons the others over, who expressed interest in such wares earlier. He alludes to a locket in his possession that has magical properties. </li>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <a href="party.html#L">"L"</a> is intrigued, and inquires about the price, which is substantial (100 GP). The barkeep says it is an item he is not supposed to have, and cautions that it can draw unwanted attention. He says it will help the bearer be more deceptive. <a href="party.html#L">"L"</a> immediately sees its use for his purposes and decides to buy it.</li>
                <li>
                    <a href="party.html#Rasputin">Rasputin</a> inquires after black market consumables the barkeep might have on offer, then changes his mind. </li>
            </ul>
            <li>
                <a href="party.html#L">"L"</a> feels a compulsion to gamble and suspects he might be able to sate that need a Dorter's. He asks the barkeep (via <a href="party.html#Nassirra">Nassirra</a>), who points to multiple gameplay opportunities in the room.</li>
            <li>Before the group moves on, the barkeep imparts some additional advice to stay within the city walls, and out of the way of the Lucavi. He also suggests we might be interested in what the bookbinder has to offer.</li>
        </ul>
        <li>
            <a href="party.html#L">"L"</a> approaches a table where a card game, similar to Black Jack, is happening. One of the patrons at the table appears to be a Lucavi knight out of uniform, wearing only the layers of clothing that would go under a set of armor. <a href="party.html#L">"L"</a> pays 5 gold pieces to play. He loses his first two rounds, and commisserates with the off-shift guard, who is also not doing particularly well, and seems to have been drinking. <a href="party.html#L">"L"</a> orders a round of porters for himself and the guard, who introduces himself as Elrich. <a href="party.html#L">"L"</a> manages to win one round, so orders even more drinks, and pressures the guard to drink more. He plans to get Elrich, take him to a private location, and then use his power of suggestion to get access to the Lucavi barracks with Elrich's help. Both <a href="party.html#L">"L"</a> and Elrich get very drunk. They begin to slur their speech, and their movement becomes unsteady. Elrich starts to loosen up a bit. He says Lucavi knights are paid well, and are all that stands between the town and the undead, but doesn't tell <a href="party.html#L">"L"</a> anything more useful than that. He orders another round, and <a href="party.html#L">"L"</a> starts to worry about whether he can handle more beer, especially after his recent illness. </li>
        <ul>
            <li>Elrich is completely wasted. He crudely expresses interest in the women at the bar, and <a href="party.html#L">"L"</a> encourages him to pursue them, seeing this as a possible opening to get some privacy and cast suggestion on Elrich. Much to <a href="party.html#L">"L"</a>'s dismay, he soon learns there are no private areas of this place, as Elrich strips down nude then and there and performs a sex act ineptly with one of the women, who is clearly a professional. The embarrassing display concludes when Elrich passes out, nude. <a href="party.html#L">"L"</a> asks the others to help him get the unconscious Elrich out of Dorter's, and preferably to somewhere with fewer prying eyes. <a href="party.html#Un-Kell">Ün-Kell</a> carries <a href="party.html#L">"L"</a>, who is too drunk to manage on his own, and drags Elrich out after covering his genitals with a cloak. </li>
            <li>
                <a href="party.html#L">"L"</a> tries to find out where Elrich lives. After several barely-conscious grunts and groans, Elrich manages to say "barracks". Soon after, a Lucavi patrol comes across the group. Clearly Elrich has a history of drunken shenanigans, and one of the knights voices disapproval at the sight of him. They insist on taking Elrich back to the barracks, and remind the group that citizens are not allowed there. <a href="party.html#L">"L"</a> convinces them to let the group follow until they reach the barracks, though he can't persuade them to let him inside.</li>
            <li>When the group reaches the entrance to the barracks, <a href="party.html#Nassirra">Nassirra</a> sneaks off to eavesdrop in a tree, but one of the knight sees her and follows. <a href="party.html#Un-Kell">Ün-Kell</a> throws a rock at the knight in an attempt to distract them from pursuing <a href="party.html#Nassirra">Nassirra</a>, but it doesn't work, and the guard just thinks <a href="party.html#Un-Kell">Ün-Kell</a> is being an asshole. The guard doesn't find <a href="party.html#Nassirra">Nassirra</a> in the nearby tree, but mutters under his breath something about telling the commander, and it becomes clear that <a href="party.html#Nassirra">Nassirra</a> can't remain hidden for long. Instead, she sneaks back to the group and pretends she was there the whole time. <a href="party.html#Un-Kell">Ün-Kell</a> asks whether he could come in to use the restroom (as a distraction), they say no and ask everyone to leave, so they do. </li>
        </ul>
    </ul>
</ul>

<h3 id="Blood and Books">Blood and Books</h3>

<ul>
    <li>As <a href="party.html#L">"L"</a>, <a href="party.html#Nassirra">Nassirra</a>, <a href="party.html#Rasputin">Rasputin</a> and <a href="party.html#Un-Kell">Ün-Kell</a> head back toward the inn, horns sound announcing the return of the scouting party through the southeastern gate. <a href="party.html#Multimodal">Multimodal</a> and <a href="party.html#Zieg">Zieg</a> hear the horns from the inn and head toward the gate as well. As the gates open, Lucavi knights lazily attempt to disperse the crowd that has formed around it. The scouting party enters, stained in blood and ichor, save for a figure in polished, pearlescent armor wearing an immacuate white hood with gold trim. The hood is part of an armored mantle. <a href="party.html#L">"L"</a> and <a href="party.html#Multimodal">Multimodal</a> detect a dark magical energy in the lining of the hood, and an inky blackness within the hood. It appears to be imbued with powerful magic.</li>
    <li>The party regroups. <a href="party.html#Multimodal">Multimodal</a> detects that <a href="party.html#L">"L"</a> has been affected by some kind of poison, and restores him to a sober state. The group that went to Dorter's gives a summary of what they learned to the other two. We decide we want to go to the Bastion eventually and talk with Champion <a href="npcs.html#Kont">Kont</a>, but given Lucia's warning that the scouting party needs some time to rest, we decide to go to the bookbinder's first.</li>
    <li>We come upon the bookbinder's shop, an unassuming building located on a hill. As we enter, we notice that the air feels quite dry, and smells normal, which is abnormal compared to the mold-ridden basin. The shop appears to be run by a human named Dain. <a href="party.html#Nassirra">Nassirra</a> speaks to him in her thieves' cant to test the waters, but he doesn't pick up what she's putting down. </li>
    <ul>
        <li>He tells us about the services he provides, which include transcribing books, selling books and spell reagents, and some spell scrolls, which are pricey. We ask about books on the history of Lucav, and especially the war of the second age, and he summons a halfling assistant named Nak to find them. <a href="party.html#Zieg">Zieg</a> detects something strange about the interpersonal dynamics between Dain and Nak. Specifically, Dain seems to be holding something over Nak beyond whatever power he holds as the shopkeeper.</li>
        <li>Recalling the <a href="lore.html#Journal">journal of Hamun Kost</a>, we ask whether Dain has a copy of the Champion <a href="npcs.html#Kont">Kont</a>'s research. He tells us that the Champion authored a book on tactics to fight the undead, and sends Nak to look for it in the archives—though we get the sense that he doesn't want the book to be found. Nak turns up empty-handed, and Dain suggests we ask the Champion ourselves. Dain tells us that <a href="npcs.html#Kont">Kont</a> has been Champion of Lucav since before his arrival, and that he has not been able to find an exact date in the record for the start of <a href="npcs.html#Kont">Kont</a>'s control. We take note.</li>
        <li>We ask about the Lucavi. Dain echoes what we've heard before, that the Lucavi are usually nobles of lower status who come to Lucav to gain honor for their house.</li>
        <li>We ask about the history of the Riovannes House. Dain tells us Riovannes was a noble house that practiced the holy arts. There is no dominant religion in Lucav, nor was there in the Riovannes House's prime, and so the Riovannes didn't follow any particular diety. The Riovannes estate was once quite large, occupying most of the basin. As the need arose, the house became a hospital, as the Dorter's barkeep alluded to earlier. When the matriarch of the family fell ill with an incurable disease, the house fell, and it now has new caretakers.</li>
        <li>We decide not to buy anything from the bookbinder, and move on to the bastion.</li>
    </ul>
    <li>As we leave the shop, <a href="party.html#Zieg">Zieg</a> expresses his concern that we are constantly being watched. He communicates that something strange was going on with Dain and Nak, and seems hesitant to trust anyone in Lucav. He warns that we should be careful what we say and who we ask about.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="Not My Champion">Not My Champion</h3>

<ul>
    <li>On our way to the bastion, <a href="party.html#Zieg">Zieg</a>'s concerns grow. He asks us to make some noise so he can perform a spell unnoticed by the guards, so <a href="party.html#L">"L"</a> and <a href="party.html#Nassirra">Nassirra</a> loudly talk about <a href="party.html#L">"L"</a>'s gambling earlier, and a very naive <a href="party.html#Multimodal">Multimodal</a> asks about the rules to the game he played.</li>
    <li>When we arrive at the bastion, we are stopped by the guards, who attempt to bar our entry. <a href="party.html#Zieg">Zieg</a> mentioned that Lucia sent us to request an audience with the Champion. The guards are skeptical, but dropping Lucia the Exalt's name gave us credibility. They allow us to enter so long as we keep our weapons sheathed. As we walk through the entrance hall, <a href="party.html#Rasputin">Rasputin</a> notices that the stone it is built with was shaped, not cut, using dwarven lithomancy. We pass by a mead hall full of people eating loudly, and approach a staircase that leads to a balcony where Champion <a href="npcs.html#Kont">Kont</a> stands, hood withdrawn. He is a pale, gaunt figure with long silver hair pulled away from his face, which stares coldly at the knights training below while he comments on their poor form.</li>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <a href="party.html#Zieg">Zieg</a> is able to detect a strong aura of undeath emanating from Champion <a href="npcs.html#Kont">Kont</a>, the sensation makes his stomach turn. <a href="party.html#Nassirra">Nassirra</a> takes notice, but thinks better of commenting in mixed company.</li>
        <li>
            <a href="party.html#Rasputin">Rasputin</a> takes notice as well, and turns his attention to Champion <a href="npcs.html#Kont">Kont</a>. He detects the coldness in <a href="npcs.html#Kont">Kont</a>'s eyes, and a desire to kill him in particular. <a href="party.html#Rasputin">Rasputin</a>'s skin darkens. He turns to <a href="npcs.html#Kont">Kont</a> and says "You are him, then," to which <a href="npcs.html#Kont">Kont</a> replies "And you are he. We have much to discuss." He asks to speak privately. <a href="party.html#Rasputin">Rasputin</a> refuses to let his back face <a href="npcs.html#Kont">Kont</a>, so <a href="npcs.html#Kont">Kont</a> leads the way. The group, apprehensive and bewildered, follows him.</li>
        <li>As we ascend a spiral staircase, <a href="npcs.html#Kont">Kont</a> tells us why he put forth a call for aid. He tells us there is a new necromancer in the area that has called forth skeletons to attack Lucav. <a href="party.html#Rasputin">Rasputin</a> mentions that we came across Hamun Kost in order to see how <a href="npcs.html#Kont">Kont</a> reacts. He asks how Hamun is doing, and <a href="party.html#Rasputin">Rasputin</a> decides to play it close to the chest, insisting that <a href="npcs.html#Kont">Kont</a> trade information with us before we tell him more. </li>
        <li>
            We enter a dark, windowed room that appears to be <a href="npcs.html#Kont">Kont</a>'s office, we notice the shades are drawn. <a href="party.html#L">"L"</a> asks whether he would mind opening the shades, to test the waters. <a href="npcs.html#Kont">Kont</a> begins to draw his hood over his head, though he says he would prefer to keep them drawn. 
        </li>
        <li>
            <a href="npcs.html#Kont">Kont</a> reveals that he detected <a href="party.html#Zieg">Zieg</a>'s magical aura and knows that we know what he is. <a href="party.html#Zieg">Zieg</a>, full of righteous fury, calls upon his spiritual guardians for aid in slaying Champion <a href="npcs.html#Kont">Kont</a>. <a href="npcs.html#Kont">Kont</a> defends himself, but does not fight back, and insists he just wants to talk. <a href="party.html#Nassirra">Nassirra</a> restrains <a href="party.html#Zieg">Zieg</a>. As she does, <a href="party.html#Zieg">Zieg</a> says "Creatures of evil speak lies all the time." After taking a moment to read the situation more carefully, <a href="party.html#Zieg">Zieg</a> sees that <a href="npcs.html#Kont">Kont</a>'s intentions may not be evil, despite his evil form. He grits his teeth as <a href="npcs.html#Kont">Kont</a> says his piece.
        </li>
        <li>
            <a href="npcs.html#Kont">Kont</a> tells us that he was once a paladin, and is now a vampire whose soul was stolen by <a href="lore.html#Orcus">Orcus</a>. <a href="party.html#L">"L"</a> and <a href="party.html#Rasputin">Rasputin</a> have heard the name before. <a href="npcs.html#Kont">Kont</a> tells us that <a href="lore.html#Orcus">Orcus</a> is the Lord of Undeath, a demon prince who owns <a href="npcs.html#Kont">Kont</a>'s soul. <a href="npcs.html#Kont">Kont</a> is subject to his will, but still has agency and thwarts <a href="lore.html#Orcus">Orcus</a>' compulsions with some success. We are skeptical. He continues to explain that <a href="lore.html#Orcus">Orcus</a> took everyone he ever loved from him.</li>
            <li>He goes on to say that our companion, <a href="party.html#Rasputin">Rasputin</a>, is the demon prince's newest vessel, beckoned to Lucav to complete a ritual that will bring the demon prince to the material plane. It is the curse of the land, he says. Since the mid-late second era, after so much blood spilled on the land, there have been repeated attempts to summon the demon prince in Lucav, all of which <a href="npcs.html#Kont">Kont</a> has thwarted. He tells us that <a href="party.html#Rasputin">Rasputin</a>'s darkening skin is a tell-tale sign that he is the demon prince's vessel. <a href="party.html#Multimodal">Multimodal</a> exchanges a concerned glance with <a href="party.html#Zieg">Zieg</a>. They have feared the darkness growing in <a href="party.html#Rasputin">Rasputin</a> for some time.
        </li>
        <li>
            <a href="party.html#Rasputin">Rasputin</a> defends himself as a monk of the long death, not an agent of undeath. He is not undead, like <a href="npcs.html#Kont">Kont</a>. <a href="npcs.html#Kont">Kont</a> condescends to him about his dojo. </li>
        <li><a href="npcs.html#Kont">Kont</a> tells us his story. His wife was killed by the Riovannes House matriarch, a vampire. He tries to revive her using a diamond, but unbeknownst to him it was a blood diamond, and so she returned not to the living, but to undeath. He ultimately had to put her down, watching his wife die for the second time. Now he is a vampire—though he has not told us exactly how that happened yet—who feeds on veisitors and some high ranking Lucavi knights who are aware of is situation. He uses necromancy himself, but in a way he finds defensible, which is to raise the dead for training purposes against the real undead hordes that threaten Lucav. We ask whether that's what's happening in the Riovannes House, and he tells us no, that the Riovannes House is overrun. </li>
        <li>He also tells us that the only way to stop <a href="lore.html#Orcus">Orcus</a> is to destroy his vessel, <a href="party.html#Rasputin">Rasputin</a>. We are shocked. <a href="party.html#Rasputin">Rasputin</a> insists there must be another way, some way we can trap <a href="lore.html#Orcus">Orcus</a> and spare him. <a href="npcs.html#Kont">Kont</a> knows of no way to contain a god, and admonishes <a href="party.html#Rasputin">Rasputin</a> for risking not only the lives of his comrades, but damning them to undeath. <a href="party.html#Rasputin">Rasputin</a> tries to commune with <a href="lore.html#Orcus">Orcus</a>, to no avail. It becomes clear to him that communication with the demon prince is strictly one-way.</li>
        <li>
            <a href="party.html#Zieg">Zieg</a>, still furious, calls <a href="npcs.html#Kont">Kont</a> on his moral failings. He says if <a href="npcs.html#Kont">Kont</a>'s intentions were truly good, he would tell us everthing he knows, and then let <a href="party.html#Zieg">Zieg</a> put him to rest. <a href="npcs.html#Kont">Kont</a> claims his purpose, to prevent <a href="lore.html#Orcus">Orcus</a> from coming to the material plane, has not yet been fulfilled, and until then he must continue on. <a href="party.html#Un-Kell">Ün-Kell</a> asks how <a href="npcs.html#Kont">Kont</a> justifies feeding on visitors. He claims he is there for a higher purpose, and that the ends justify the means. </li>
        <li>
            <a href="party.html#Multimodal">Multimodal</a> asks how long we have until <a href="party.html#Rasputin">Rasputin</a> is no longer himself. <a href="npcs.html#Kont">Kont</a> tells us that <a href="party.html#Rasputin">Rasputin</a> will remain himself until the ritual is complete, when enough blood has been spilled on the land, and when the vessel stands in the basin. </li>
        <li>We ask <a href="npcs.html#Kont">Kont</a> how we can trust his information. He gives us a key and an official seal, which he says will give us access to the Riovannes House. He has a long history with that house, he tells us, and that we will find a tome inside that can answer some of our questions. </li>
        <li>
            <a href="party.html#Rasputin">Rasputin</a> asks what information he can give us about the last vessel, and he says he will try to get information for us, but that he is unable to enter the House of Record. It seems some wards surrounding the building prevent the undead from entering.</li>
        <li>He warns us that pillars of bone rise from the earth around Lucav whenever <a href="lore.html#Orcus">Orcus</a>' vessel returns, and that these pillars beckon undead where they stand.</li>
        <li>We ask whether we can access a copy of his book on undead combat, for training purposes. He remarks with contempt that he was expecting professionals to respond to his call, with no need for training, but he will provide us with the book nonetheless. </li>
        <li>In an act of reciprocity, we share Hamun Kost's journal entries with <a href="npcs.html#Kont">Kont</a>, which he reads disapprovingly. He tells us that Hamun Kost was supposed to be his replacement, but he instead became hungry for power and betrayed <a href="npcs.html#Kont">Kont</a>. </li>
        <li>
            <a href="party.html#Zieg">Zieg</a> says "This has bought you time with my friends, but to satisfy me I require your sword." <a href="npcs.html#Kont">Kont</a> is bewildered and responds with a patronizing tone that he has many weapons and is unable to wield the light swords of his knights, but <a href="party.html#Zieg">Zieg</a> stands on principle, and <a href="npcs.html#Kont">Kont</a> turns over his warhammer. In return, <a href="party.html#Zieg">Zieg</a> releases his spiritual guardians.</li>
    </ul>
    <li>We are then escorted out of the bastion, left to contemplate our next move.</span></li>

<h3 id="When Knowledge isn't Power">When Knowledge isn't Power</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Knowing what the group is likely to face in the Riovannes house, <a href="party.html#Multimodal">Multimodal</a> decides to visit Shield to upgrade her armor, and <a href="party.html#Un-Kell">Ün-Kell</a> comes along to look at shiny things. <a href="party.html#Multimodal">Multimodal</a> ends up buying ethically sourced, fair trade scale mail. <a href="party.html#Un-Kell">Ün-Kell</a> decides not to buy anything.</li>
    <li>Meanwhile, <a href="party.html#Nassirra">Nassirra</a>, <a href="party.html#Zieg">Zieg</a>, <a href="party.html#Rasputin">Rasputin</a>, and <a href="party.html#L">"L"</a> decide to visit the nearby House of Record. They approach a simple door, guarded by a priest wearing a green robe with a faux-gold trim. The priest bows and welcomes them. <a href="party.html#Nassirra">Nassirra</a> launches into an elaborate explanation for the group's presence there, saying that we are travelers who want to see the famed House of Record, and the priest simply remarks that the House of Record is open to the public, beckoning them inside.</li>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <a href="party.html#Nassirra">Nassirra</a> wants to scope out the room, and discover where the restricted section would be. The room is lit by lazily floating orbs of light along the eaves of the building. There is a stone relief of a tree symbol, emblematic of the worship of Zivilyn, and a map of the continent Arkovia. <a href="party.html#L">"L"</a> asks a priest standing at something like a customer service counter whether anything is off-limits, and is told that everything within the room is accessible to the public, but the rest of the facility is only accessible to priests. </li>
        <li>
            <a href="party.html#Zieg">Zieg</a> goes to the public shrine to Zivilyn to pray for knowledge to help him. He makes a small donation to the shrine. <a href="party.html#Rasputin">Rasputin</a> asks <a href="party.html#Zieg">Zieg</a> for help in determining how to contain Orkus, if possible. </li>
        <li>
            <a href="party.html#Zieg">Zieg</a> and <a href="party.html#Rasputin">Rasputin</a> try to research more about Orkus. <a href="party.html#Zieg">Zieg</a> is only able to find information we've encountered already, and finds no new information about the vessel or the ritual. He suspects more information may be forbidden knowledge, perhaps located in the restricted area. <a href="party.html#Zieg">Zieg</a> tells <a href="party.html#Rasputin">Rasputin</a> he hasn't learned anything new, and <a href="party.html#Rasputin">Rasputin</a> instead researches general processes of rebirth into a vessel. He learns that it is not well understood, and falls under the umbrella of necromancy. He reads that some vessels can contain multiple souls. Some of the information overlaps with what we learned about golemancy. Some of the things you can bind are not humanoids or intelligent creatures. Binding souls to objects can be involved in creating liches, who successfully bind their soul to another object, but experience consequences. The latter requires powerful magic to perform. <a href="party.html#Rasputin">Rasputin</a> wants to know how possession can be prevented. There are lots of stories about cases of possessions, or reasons why someone might become possessed—most of which blame the victim—but there is not much information about the process.</li>
        <li>
            <a href="party.html#L">"L"</a> researches the history of the Eladrin, and mostly finds what we've already learned elsewhere, but does get some new information. One tome gives a deep dive into the culture of the Eladrin from somebody who spent some time with them. They are different from other elves in that they embrace and celebrate emotional whims, individuality, and self-expression, for both positive and negative emotions, and they display their emotions publicly. Cities exist within massive trees in the fey wild, shaped by shaman tree-shapers. The greatest such structure is a grand castle Y'fethal Dar in the kingdom of Huen'Taen. In the Fey wild, which is a parallel plane, so there should be a correspondence in the material plane.</li>
        <li>
            <a href="party.html#Nassirra">Nassirra</a> looks into the history of Lucav, and specifically the Riovannes House, but finds only a novel that dramatizes the events of the Riovannes House. She skims the novel and gets the sense that it follows the story of a dwarven woman who came to Lucav, married into the family, and killed a bunch of people. It's unclear how historically accurate the novel is. </li>
        <li> The group reads about the Goddess Lhasra. Similar to Orkus, she is the goddess of undeath. The writings describe a fel ritual involving the blood of the recently deceased, someone who was murdered, and followers use it to bind evil creatures to their will. There are many warnings against doing it, as usually followers get killed by what they summon from outer planes. The descriptions are deliberately vague, because nobody wants anyone performing the rituals.</li>
        <li>
            <a href="party.html#Rasputin">Rasputin</a> recalls the scale we found in <a href="npcs.html#Glasstaff">Glasstaff</a>'s manor, and decides to research the Yuan-Ti. <a href="party.html#L">"L"</a> assists him and finds the public library doesn't have much information on them. He gets a high-level synopsis about them from a travel book of some kind covering the southern reaches of Arkovia, which describes the Yuan-Ti as people who worship and take the form of snakes. There is some speculation about how to spot them; some of them look like humanoids with snake heads, others suggest they may only have snake-like eyes or features, and scales located somewhere on the body, often hidden under clothes, or they may have a cleft lower lip like a snake. It is an entire advanced civilization, but they don't generally interact with others, and don't play nice when they do. <a href="party.html#Nassirra">Nassirra</a> is familiar with them from her experience with the Fetid Tangle, and she thinks they could be the source of the psionic power the orcs were using, but we have no evidence of that. </li>
    </ul>


    <li>
        <a href="party.html#L">"L"</a> lets the group know, subtly, that the information we want generally isn't available in the public part of the House of Record. </li>
    <li>
        <a href="party.html#Nassirra">Nassirra</a> cases the joint. There are few windows, only narrow stained glass slits that are very old, perhaps because they lacked the technology for making large glass panes. The window would be difficult to get through. She finds the entrance to temple, which is an archway etched with words along the arch, and a silvery, shimmering field inside the arch, which is semi-transparent. She asks <a href="party.html#Zieg">Zieg</a> what's going on with the door, and <a href="party.html#Zieg">Zieg</a> recruits <a href="party.html#L">"L"</a> to help. <a href="party.html#Zieg">Zieg</a> knows the Celestial language, and can read the text around the doorway somewhat. He is able to recognize that they are riddles or puzzles of some kind, and gets the sense that the text has a double meaning which might help open the doorway. To write the text down, he asks a priest for a pen and paper, under the guise that he needs to write the names of tomes in the library to compare against another list elsewhere, but the priest insists on writing the names himself. <a href="party.html#Zieg">Zieg</a> provides the name of the most recent tome he read to save face. <a href="party.html#L">"L"</a> checks what the barrier on the door might be made of, and he can detect that has a strange quality. He believes it is a planar portal or at least a portal that spans some distance.</li>
    <li>
        <a href="party.html#Rasputin">Rasputin</a> compares the map of Arkovia to the cryptic treasure map we found. <a href="party.html#Nassirra">Nassirra</a> is worried he will draw suspicion on us, and tries to grab it from him, but is apparently unsuccessful. <a href="party.html#Rasputin">Rasputin</a> examines several of the named locations on the map. Ars Vox is the capital city in the northeast, where the Ashen are from. Birkvom is the capital of Froytlein, and is ruled by the kings of the southern Dwarf families. He notes the city of Rubau within Fetid Tangle to the southeast, within the southern reach of Kaetluf. The maps don't align perfectly, and so <a href="party.html#Rasputin">Rasputin</a> tells a priest that their map is wrong.</li>
    <li>
        <a href="party.html#Nassirra">Nassirra</a> looks at her own reflection in the doorway to gauge how the priests react. Her reflection moves a little bit. The boundary appears to change light and color, and she gets the sense that the lighting in the room on the other side of the barrier is different, as if maybe it's a different time of day there than here. The priests ask if she needs anything. She tells them their mirror sucks, and wants them to think she's unintelligent.</li>
    <li>
        <a href="party.html#L">"L"</a> asks whether there are any particularly rare manuscripts or tomes there. The priest is offended by the question, and <a href="party.html#L">"L"</a> subsequently asks for forgiveness, explaining that we're trying to help the Lucavi fight off the undead. He name drops <a href="npcs.html#Kont">Kont</a>, but sadly we aren't able to find what we need. <a href="party.html#L">"L"</a> tries to persuade the priest that we are not "the public", and the priestess argues we are quite "the public". Offers to give us specific knowledge directly if we need it, but when <a href="party.html#L">"L"</a> asks for that information, he is told to leave. <a href="party.html#Rasputin">Rasputin</a> approaches the priest, tries to appeal to their interest in applying knowledge to defeat evil. The priest is hesitant, and warns forbidden knowledge can be dangerou, but admits they sometimes apply their knowledge for the greater good. The priest agrees to pass along the information to the higher ups and see what they say. <a href="party.html#Rasputin">Rasputin</a> warns them that time is short and he will need to know soon, then makes a dramatic exit. The rest of the group follows suit.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="The Haunting of Riovannes House">The Haunting of Riovannes House</h3>
<ul>
    <li>We regroup at about noon and decide to proceed to the Riovannes House. By now the fog has lifted. As we approach the house, we note it is in disrepair, and the windows have been boarded up. The entrance is secured with a heavy chain. We notice guards posted outside, one in a guard tower nearby, and another guarding the entrance. We take out the seal <a href="npcs.html#Kont">Kont</a> gave us, wich bears the symbol of the Lucavi knights: a bullseye symbol with white and dark gray colors alternating. <a href="party.html#Multimodal">Multimodal</a> uses her Firbolg magic to determine whether the symbol has magical properties, concerned that it could allow somoene to scry on at us. She finds that it isn't magical, and shares the information with the group.</li>
    <ul>
        <li>A guard stops us at the door, and warns us that the building is off-limits. <a href="party.html#L">"L"</a> presents the seal and tells the guard we're under Champion <a href="npcs.html#Kont">Kont</a>'s orders to enter the building. The guard seems hesitant, and asks us if we know what's in the house, concerned that what's inside is a risk to the whole town. <a href="party.html#L">"L"</a> asks if we can give a safe word or other code to be let out if we need to retreat. He tells us that we won't be able leave if we don't clear the building, for the safety of the town. We give the safeword "banana", and the guard calls for backup in case we loose undead on the town.</li>
        <li>The guard unlocks the door, and we enter. It's dark. <a href="party.html#Zieg">Zieg</a> casts light on Dawnbringer, and bids us all to stay brave, look out after each other, and come out alive. We enter a foyer and notice a reception area nearby.</li>
        <li>
            <a href="party.html#Rasputin">Rasputin</a> feels a familiar darkness coming over his skin, and hears the sound of scratching coming from somewhere in the building, but finds it difficult to localize. <a href="party.html#Rasputin">Rasputin</a> sees a pink, fleshy creature on his left as he enters a large room. We prepare for combat.</li><ul>
        <li>
            <span class="combat"><a href="party.html#L">"L"</a> prepares an Eldritch Blast to attack if the creature approaches. <a href="party.html#Zieg">Zieg</a> protects <a href="party.html#Rasputin">Rasputin</a> from evil and tells him "where you go, I'm going." <a href="party.html#Multimodal">Multimodal</a> summons eight giant badgers (the Feytful Eight), and puts them on the front line. Some agile undead charge at us; one from the reception area tries to attack <a href="party.html#Nassirra">Nassirra</a> and misses, and the other bursts from the shadows and attacks a badger. <a href="party.html#L">"L"</a> looses his Eldritch Blast and slams the creature into the wall. <a href="party.html#Nassirra">Nassirra</a> attacks the creature that went after her with her short sword and nearly kills it. Bob flies around a bit and sees three undead, reports that information back to <a href="party.html#L">"L"</a>, and takes the help action on the first creature <a href="party.html#Rasputin">Rasputin</a> saw. Eleven other undead creatures emerge from the adjacent rooms and attack the badgers, killing one of them. <a href="party.html#Un-Kell">Ün-Kell</a> becomes enraged and attacks recklessly, slaying the undead creature that attacked <a href="party.html#Nassirra">Nassirra</a>. He then turns to a horrific undead creature that looks like it was once humanoid, but has no eyes, its bones have been rearranged, has elven-like ears, its legs resemble those of a dog in structure, and its chest rotated around where a humanoid's back would be. <a href="party.html#Un-Kell">Ün-Kell</a> puts it out of its misery. Badgers attack and kill several similar undead creatures. <a href="party.html#Rasputin">Rasputin</a> jumps along the backs of the badgers to get the upper ground, then drives his staff down into one of undead creatures, and launches a barrage of unarmed strikes against it, slaying it. He then kicks another, slaying it as well, then strikes the agile zombie nearby. </span></li>
        <li>
            <span class="combat"><a href="party.html#L">"L"</a> casts hex on one of the foul undead creatures and slays it with Eldritch Blasts. <a href="party.html#Zieg">Zieg</a> surrounds the agile undead creature near <a href="party.html#Rasputin">Rasputin</a> with sacred flame, and <a href="party.html#Multimodal">Multimodal</a> finishes it off with radiant dazefire. <a href="party.html#Nassirra">Nassirra</a> moves toward the end of the hall and launches her swords at one of the undead monstrosities, killing it. In turn, the undead monstrosities kill one of the badgers, but fail to strike the rest of the party. <a href="party.html#Un-Kell">Ün-Kell</a> rushes to the front line and attacks, killing two of them. The fey badgers kill the rest of the undead creatures at the end of the main hall. <a href="party.html#Rasputin">Rasputin</a> kills the remaining monsters in adjacent rooms using sick anime-style moves. </span>
        </li>
    </ul>
        <li>
            We end combat and explore our surroundings. <a href="party.html#Zieg">Zieg</a> notices a strange symbol on a purple rug in the main hall, which he suspects is an emblem of House Riovannes. <a href="party.html#Rasputin">Rasputin</a> enters an old crafts room of some kind, with beds but no bedding, a pedestal with an incomplete wood carving, and a doorway leading to a closet that is bare save for one piece of clothing. <a href="party.html#Multimodal">Multimodal</a> investigates the bizarre new creatures we fought that look vaguely humanoid, but walk like dogs. There are no strange worms infesting it, unlike the undead we saw in Lilygrove. 
        </li>
        <li>
            <a href="party.html#Nassirra">Nassirra</a> and <a href="party.html#Un-Kell">Ün-Kell</a> investigate the large room we fought in and find a large table and a fireplace that has not been used in some time. <a href="party.html#Nassirra">Nassirra</a> investigates a nearby room which looks like an old storeroom. There is little useful inside, but she finds just enough supplies to make a rudimentary healer's kit. <a href="party.html#L">"L"</a> investigates what appears to be an abandoned office. He lights a torch and finds another closet containing only a small wooden box, covered in dust. The box contains old, yellowed paper that might tear if he tried to read it. <a href="party.html#L">"L"</a> decides to tuck the box away for the time being. 
        </li>
        <li>
            <a href="party.html#Un-Kell">Ün-Kell</a> sees a small room with a bed inside. He lights a torch, enters, and finds several other beds and a closet on the south side of the room. Under one of the beds he finds a small wood carving. On further inspection, he realizes it is a small horse figurine, which he assumes is a clue.
        </li>
        <li>
            <a href="party.html#Rasputin">Rasputin</a> finds a privvy in the old house, and decides to make use of it. He meditates while in the bathroom and tries to feel Orkus' presence. He feels oddly comfortable in the Riovannes House. <a href="party.html#Zieg">Zieg</a> looks under the rug and unleashes a flurry of dust, but finds nothing of interest. The floor underneath appears to be solid stone.
        </li>
        <li>
            <a href="party.html#L">"L"</a> and <a href="party.html#Nassirra">Nassirra</a> investigate the office further, banging on walls and searching for secret rooms. The wall next to the closet sounds thin. <a href="party.html#L">"L"</a> inspects the wall more closely, and finds a small gap in the wall between wooden planks. Through the gap, he can see the lantern light cast on another wall. <a href="party.html#L">"L"</a> tells <a href="party.html#Nassirra">Nassirra</a> about the room, and she holds her ear up to the wall while <a href="party.html#L">"L"</a> tells the rest of us about what he found. <a href="party.html#Nassirra">Nassirra</a> hears a distant echo on the edge of her hearing, like the sound of water, and lets the group know about it. She also investigates a pantry adjoining the large room she had been in before, but finds nothing. <a href="party.html#Multimodal">Multimodal</a> and her badgers head to the thin wall, as does <a href="party.html#Rasputin">Rasputin</a>. The badgers scratch and pull at the wall, and we help pull the wooden panels off after they have loosened them, revealing a descending stairwell. 
        </li>
        <li>
            We descend the stairs. The badgers lead the group, one of whom <a href="party.html#Zieg">Zieg</a> has enchanted with light, followed by <a href="party.html#Un-Kell">Ün-Kell</a>. They encounter a sticky blue fluid on the ground. The rest of the group joins them at the bottom of the stairwell. <a href="party.html#Nassirra">Nassirra</a> can hear scraping sounds that are difficult to localize. She sees that the hallway branches north and south. <a href="party.html#Un-Kell">Ün-Kell</a> and <a href="party.html#Nassirra">Nassirra</a> explore the branching point and notice that it spans the length of the upstairs hall. She can see water coming from under a doorway to the south. <a href="party.html#L">"L"</a> investigates the sticky, blue liquid, which appears to be organic and possibly quite flammable, emitting a foul odor. <a href="party.html#Rasputin">Rasputin</a> starts to head north and finds another branching hallway lined with jail cells. He hears whispers and feels strange in this place. He tells <a href="party.html#Zieg">Zieg</a> this, who says "it is often dark before we get there, press on with the light". <a href="party.html#Zieg">Zieg</a> and <a href="party.html#Nassirra">Nassirra</a> come with <a href="party.html#Rasputin">Rasputin</a> as he proceeds north. He hears a loud clanging sound coming from one of the cells, and sees one of the monstrous undead creatures locked within, badly injured, but contained. <a href="party.html#Rasputin">Rasputin</a> and <a href="party.html#Zieg">Zieg</a> slay the creature. <a href="party.html#Zieg">Zieg</a> turns to his companions and says "stay smart, stay together, stay alive". <a href="party.html#Nassirra">Nassirra</a> sees old blood spatter on the walls. The rest of the holding cells are empty. <a href="party.html#Nassirra">Nassirra</a> unlocks the last cell on the left and investigates with <a href="party.html#Un-Kell">Ün-Kell</a>'s help, but doesn't find anything. She suddenly feels on edge, and rushes out of the cell, into the hallway with <a href="party.html#Un-Kell">Ün-Kell</a>. <a href="party.html#Rasputin">Rasputin</a> continues to hear whispering in some kind of foreign language. Nobody else is able to hear it.
        </li>
        <li>
            <a href="party.html#Multimodal">Multimodal</a>, standing guard with her badgers near the stairwell, hears a chuckling sound coming from the south. She gestures to the rest of the group to indicate that something is going on. <a href="party.html#Rasputin">Rasputin</a> and <a href="party.html#Nassirra">Nassirra</a> join her, and the others follow suit. <a href="party.html#Rasputin">Rasputin</a> rushes to the front of the line and sees a large cell with blue goo emerging from it on his left, and the door with water running under it to his right. There's some kind of torture apparatus in the large cell, but he can't see the rest of the cell.
        </li>
        <li>
            <a href="party.html#Nassirra">Nassirra</a> puts her ear to the door across from the cell and hears the same dripping sound she heard earlier, and a shuffling sound. She opens the door, and we are suddenly hit with an overwhelming, rank smell.</li>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <span class="combat">A pair of dark gray, decomposed creatures, excreting blue ooze, burst from the room and come after us. They projectile vomit the blue goo onto <a href="party.html#Zieg">Zieg</a> and one of the badgers. The badgers swarm them and attack. <a href="party.html#Nassirra">Nassirra</a> launches her shortsword into the creature with her vines.  <a href="party.html#L">"L"</a> places a hex on one of the oozing creatures and launches a barrage of Eldritch Blasts at the target. <a href="party.html#Zieg">Zieg</a> is coated in nasty blue goop. He conjures a spiritual weapon and attacks the zombie who gooped him with it. <a href="party.html#Un-Kell">Ün-Kell</a> snuffs out his torch to prevent it from igniting the blue goop, damaging hismelf slightly in the process, then launches his javelin at the zombie. <a href="party.html#Rasputin">Rasputin</a> jabs the nearest oozing zombie in the face, then slams it on its head, and beats it with unarmed strikes. <a href="party.html#Multimodal">Multimodal</a> tries to ignite one with radiant flame, but misses.</span>

The other attacks <a href="party.html#Multimodal">Multimodal</a> and misses, then retreats. <a href="party.html#Multimodal">Multimodal</a> tries to hit it with her staff, but misses. Oozing zombies grab for <a href="party.html#Nassirra">Nassirra</a>, but miss. She takes an attack of opportunity on a second zombie retreating. Two Badgers attack the zombie, others run north and find a shadowform, bite it. <a href="party.html#Nassirra">Nassirra</a> casts hunter's mark on the zombie that attacked her and subsequently destroys it. She pursues the other zombie and discovers two more zombies laying in wait that swipe at her, and she retaliates by lunging her sword with her vines, then jumps on the nearby table to get a better vantage point. <a href="party.html#L">"L"</a> prepares an attack spell against the shadow creatures. <a href="party.html#Zieg">Zieg</a> turns to <a href="party.html#Rasputin">Rasputin</a> and <a href="party.html#Un-Kell">Ün-Kell</a> and asks one of them to help <a href="party.html#Multimodal">Multimodal</a> and <a href="party.html#L">"L"</a> fight the mysterious shadow creatures that emerged from the walls.

He swoops down and scratches it in the eyes, rendering it vulnerable to attack. Un-kell charges into the room and separates one of the zombies from its arm. <a href="party.html#Rasputin">Rasputin</a> hesitates for a moment, then decides to head up the hallway to pursue the shadowform creatures that attacked <a href="party.html#Multimodal">Multimodal</a> and one of the badgers. He strikes the creature through the bars using a sequence of blows with his staff, at which it disincorporates, and as it does, <a href="party.html#Rasputin">Rasputin</a> hears unintelligible whispers. The whispers anger him, so he yells "Shut the fuck up!" and then kicks the shadow creature with another barrage of attacks, destroying it. He shouts down that the shadowform is gone, and <a href="party.html#Multimodal">Multimodal</a> shouts back to say there are more. She saw the one that attacked a badger head south down the hallway, and follows in that direction. </span>

                <span class="combat">The shadowform appears form a wall and descends on <a href="party.html#L">"L"</a>, who was prepared to launch Repelling Blasts at it when it re-emerged, knocking it backwards. The oozing zombies lurk forward and <a href="party.html#Zieg">Zieg</a> wards himself with a flare, but all of them successfully attack <a href="party.html#Zieg">Zieg</a>, <a href="party.html#Nassirra">Nassirra</a>, and <a href="party.html#Un-Kell">Ün-Kell</a>. <a href="party.html#Un-Kell">Ün-Kell</a>'s poison cloak emits a cloud of poison, but it has no effect on the zombies. The remaining badgers head toward the zombies and attack in a frenzy of teeth and claws. <a href="party.html#Nassirra">Nassirra</a> attacks a nearby zombie with a series of attacks. <a href="party.html#L">"L"</a> heads south down the hallway and warns <a href="party.html#Rasputin">Rasputin</a> that there's another shadow creature to the south, then enters the oozing-zombie fray. He hexes one of them and launches an Eldritch Blast at it. <a href="party.html#Zieg">Zieg</a> channels the light of Pelor to empower his allies, then strikes the armless zombie with his spiritual weapon. <a href="party.html#Un-Kell">Ün-Kell</a> is determined to destroy the zombie that foiled his poison cloud, and proceeds to do so. He believes the horse figurine has a bigger purpose, brings it out of his pocket, holds it outstretched towards another zombie, and proclaims "by the power of this tastefully-crafting horse figurine, I compel you to stop". It's unclear whether it had any effect. He then strikes it with his greatsword, which has an obvious effect. <a href="party.html#Rasputin">Rasputin</a> launches his ninja star at one of the zombies. <a href="party.html#Multimodal">Multimodal</a> transforms into a snake and sneaks between the bars to find the shadowform creature.</span>

                <span class="combat"> The shadowform creature slashes at <a href="party.html#Multimodal">Multimodal</a>, sending searing pain through her body, knocking her out of her snake form and back to her true form. It runs away, and she tries to strike it with her staff, but misses. She exclaims "Curse you!" in frustration as it gets away. The ooze zombies attack <a href="party.html#Nassirra">Nassirra</a>. Two of the badgers saw where the shadowform creature ran and pursue it. They find it hiding in a cell and inflict some damage to it. The remaining badgers attack the zombies in front of them. <a href="party.html#Nassirra">Nassirra</a> strikes against the zombie in retaliation with a barrage of sword strikes, killing it. <a href="party.html#L">"L"</a> turns his attention to the last ooze zombie standing, launching two Eldritch Blasts toward it. <a href="party.html#Zieg">Zieg</a> attempts to strike it with his spiritual weapon, but it misses. He raises Dawnbringer, glowing, and slams it triumphantly into the zombie. Bob sees the badgers fighting another shadowform creature and decides to help, diving down and scratching its eyes. Un-kell strikes it with his greatsword and destroys the last zombie standing, shouting "serves you right for ignoring my horse" as he does. <a href="party.html#Rasputin">Rasputin</a> runs north to help the badgers slay the shadowform creature, successfully. </span>

    <li>The fight dies down and we appear to be safe. The group takes a moment to catch their breath and explore their surroundings. </li>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <a href="party.html#Nassirra">Nassirra</a> realizes she has been standing on a makeshift operating table covered in bloodstains, surgical tools, and the remnants of flesh. On the northern end of the room, <a href="party.html#Un-Kell">Ün-Kell</a> sees two structures: a giant stone structure with small doors concealing cubby holes, and a large furnace. <a href="party.html#Zieg">Zieg</a> recognizes the stone drawers as storage for corpses. He signals for <a href="party.html#Un-Kell">Ün-Kell</a> to be ready as he prepares to check each of the doors in turn.
                <ul>
                    <li> 
                        The first few are empty, but deep enough to store a body, confirming <a href="party.html#Zieg">Zieg</a>'s assumption. When he opens the 4th door, he finds a decaying body covered in ooze. It's an asimar man wearing scale mail, perhaps a previous adventurer. The tar substance covering the body appears to be a preservative agent, and the body was in the process of becoming an ooze zombie. <a href="party.html#Zieg">Zieg</a> casts sacred flame on the body. It doesn't move. He decides to search the body more carefully and finds several items, including a necklace made of an owlbear claw, and a letter on his person from a child named Rilo. <a href="party.html#Zieg">Zieg</a> collects everything that appears to have value and stores it in the bag of holding. 
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        He continues investigating until he gets to the 7th locker, which has another body inside, more advanced along the tar transformation than the last one. <a href="party.html#Zieg">Zieg</a> casts sacred flame again to cleanse the body. It makes popping and hissing sounds, but does not move. <a href="party.html#Un-Kell">Ün-Kell</a> searches the body and recovers items from it. 
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        They continue searching the cubbies and discover yet another body mid-transformation, skin blue, and repeat the sacred flame and search procedure. The body appears to have been a Dragonborn with blue scales, which <a href="party.html#Zieg">Zieg</a> initially confused for the blue tar. From the items on her person, it appears that in life the body was spiritual, like a cleric or a paladin. One item is a Coin of Varidus, a holy symbol. <a href="party.html#Zieg">Zieg</a> recalls that Varidus is a god of storms. He prays to Pelor to help the adventurer find her way to Varidus.  
                    </li>
                </ul>
            <li>
                In the cell where <a href="party.html#Multimodal">Multimodal</a> stands, there are wooden standing restraints and etches in the stone floor to measure distances, presumably to see how far someone in the restraints could move. There is a freestanding cage made entirely of metal. There are empty shelves in the corner of the room, and a desk with old papers on it and some drawers in the northwestern corner of the room. </li>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        She approaches the desk and finds extremely old papers, and a locked drawer with a red ‘x' on it. <a href="party.html#Multimodal">Multimodal</a> asks Bob to get the key from his master, and other members of the group try to unlock the door and get in. In the meantime, <a href="party.html#Multimodal">Multimodal</a> reads the papers that appear to be some kind of human subjects research, experiments that killed some of the subjects, written in a cold, detached tone.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                         <a href="party.html#Nassirra">Nassirra</a> picks the lock of the cell door, and enters the room with <a href="party.html#Rasputin">Rasputin</a>, <a href="party.html#L">"L"</a>, and <a href="party.html#Nassirra">Nassirra</a>. <a href="party.html#Multimodal">Multimodal</a> tells the others about what she found in the notes, somberly, then gestures to the locked drawer and looks at <a href="party.html#L">"L"</a>. He cautiously inserts the key, and it seems to fit. 
                     </li>
                     <li>
                        <a href="party.html#L">"L"</a> opens the drawer, which appears to be mostly empty, save for a dark, bound tome. As <a href="party.html#L">"L"</a> gazes upon the book, he feels a strong compulsion to reach for it, and hears the voice of his master telling him not to read the book. He grabs the book from the drawer. He appears to feel sick. <a href="party.html#Multimodal">Multimodal</a> asks whether she should hold on to the book, seeing its effects on <a href="party.html#L">"L"</a>. He tells us that he senses a strong dark energy from the book that he just barely resisted, and thinks we shouldn't read the book. Since he did appear to resist its effects, he decides to hold onto it. 
                     </li>
                     <li>
                        <a href="party.html#Rasputin">Rasputin</a> opens a door to the south side of the room. He finds a wooden bed with torn leather restraints cast off to the side of it. He explores another room and finds a tiny chair (9"x9" seat) with restraints on it, facing away from the door. There are thin pieces of wood piled in the corner that appear to be signs. <a href="party.html#Rasputin">Rasputin</a> looks at the signs but can't read the language the signs are written in. <a href="party.html#Rasputin">Rasputin</a> attacks the tiny chair. <a href="party.html#Multimodal">Multimodal</a> ears the sounds of combat and rushes to <a href="party.html#Rasputin">Rasputin</a>'s aid, only to discover that he's attacking the chair for no reason. She's off-put by what she sees, and worries she may have lost her friend to Orcus. She expresses some concern over his behavior, and he puts her at ease by drinking from his flask and expressing excitement about scimitars.
                    </li>
                    <li> 
                        He draws <a href="party.html#Multimodal">Multimodal</a>'s attention to the signs in the corner. She's unable to read the script, but recalls <a href="party.html#L">"L"</a>'s ability to understand languages with magic, and brings the signs to him. Initially, he can only tell that the signs are written in Infernal.

        From the hallway, <a href="party.html#Multimodal">Multimodal</a> can hear her badgers making agitated, panicked sounds in the hall. They seem nervous about something. She comes out to check on them and notices the smell of smoke, eyes stinging. She heads toward the stairs and is hit with a strong smell of smoke accompanied by the sound of lapping flames coming from the first floor, which is clearly on fire. She alerts the rest of the group, and we start trying to find a safe way out. 
    </li>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <a href="party.html#L">"L"</a> drops his understand languages ritual and heads over to the furnace to see whether we can escape from the exhaust chute. It's giving off heat, full of soot, and appears to be too narrow for us to pass through. <a href="party.html#L">"L"</a> sends Bob through the chute, and Bob struggles to fly through the narrow passage, falling and apologizing several times. He makes his way to the fire place we saw on the first floor. Through his mind link, <a href="party.html#L">"L"</a> sees the first floor is full of smoke and engulfed in flame. The roof of the house collapses, and <a href="party.html#L">"L"</a> recalls Bob from the flames. 
            </li>
            <li>
                <a href="party.html#Rasputin">Rasputin</a> tracks the water to the north, along with <a href="party.html#Zieg">Zieg</a>, <a href="party.html#Nassirra">Nassirra</a>, and <a href="party.html#Un-Kell">Ün-Kell</a>. <a href="party.html#Un-Kell">Ün-Kell</a> gets there first, but can't see anything in the dark. <a href="party.html#Rasputin">Rasputin</a> identifies a small crack in the corner of the room and nestles a force egg in the crack, then tells the rest of the group "you should probably back away" as he runs off, waiting to detonate the grenade. <a href="party.html#Rasputin">Rasputin</a> then detonates the force egg, opening the crack further. </li>
                <ul>
                <li>
                    <a href="party.html#Rasputin">Rasputin</a> fills <a href="party.html#Multimodal">Multimodal</a> in on his plan, and she beckons her badgers to help pull away the stone wall, beyond which there is soft, wet earth. They expose some of the earth, and <a href="party.html#Rasputin">Rasputin</a> decides to place another force egg and expose more earth. There is stone rubble in the way that the badgers can't cope with. <a href="party.html#Rasputin">Rasputin</a> calls out for <a href="party.html#Un-Kell">Ün-Kell</a> to help us clear out the rubble. 
                </li>
                <li>
                    <a href="party.html#Multimodal">Multimodal</a> notices there is plenty of ground here, and the ground seems to have shifted. It appears to be soaked through, and it seems to be structurally sound. She notices a small, suspiciously even crack in the wall, and she can see there's something on the other side. She pulls at the bricks and opens up. She tells <a href="party.html#Rasputin">Rasputin</a> about the small room with a secret cache of weapons and torture tools. She then transforms into a giant badger herself and begins digging a tunnel out of the basement. She summons the badgers back to help her dig the tunnel. When she hears <a href="party.html#Rasputin">Rasputin</a> call out to her, she and her badgerfolk turn around and head for the hallway.
                </li>

            <li>
                <a href="party.html#Zieg">Zieg</a> investigates some of the other cells. He feels a bit of a draft coming from one of the halls. He can tell there's a trap wall, but can't find the switch. He asks <a href="party.html#Nassirra">Nassirra</a> and <a href="party.html#Un-Kell">Ün-Kell</a> for aid. 
            </li>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <a href="party.html#Un-Kell">Ün-Kell</a> suspects the tiny horse figurine might be the key, and investigates the surrounding area. <a href="party.html#Zieg">Zieg</a> sees <a href="party.html#Un-Kell">Ün-Kell</a> and is very confused. <a href="party.html#Multimodal">Multimodal</a> sends a badger to try and slap the horse figurine out of <a href="party.html#Un-Kell">Ün-Kell</a>'s hand, and they begin a game of keep-away. <a href="party.html#Un-Kell">Ün-Kell</a> becomes increasingly convinced that the horse is important.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <a href="party.html#Zieg">Zieg</a> can't figure out how to open the door, so he asks <a href="party.html#Un-Kell">Ün-Kell</a> to help him. At this time, the badger responds to <a href="party.html#Multimodal">Multimodal</a>'s summons, which <a href="party.html#Un-Kell">Ün-Kell</a> takes as a sign of his ultimate victory. He slams into the wall. The wall gives and opens up. He continues to bash against the wall and reveals a long, dark hallway. <a href="party.html#Nassirra">Nassirra</a> calls out to the rest of us to let us know they found another way out, and <a href="party.html#Rasputin">Rasputin</a> tells <a href="party.html#Multimodal">Multimodal</a>. He then calls out for <a href="party.html#L">"L"</a>. 
                </li>
            </ul>
            <li>
                <a href="party.html#L">"L"</a> begins a ritual to create a tiny hut that we can hide in safely, in case the building collapses on us. The ceiling begins to crack, loudly, but he is able to maintain concentration on his ritual. Before he can finish the ritual, he hears the others call out to him about the passage they found. 
            </li>
            <li>
                We cram into the narrow tunnel and push our way through. What we realize is the tunnel is made of worked stone and it extends away from the Riovannes House. <a href="party.html#Rasputin">Rasputin</a> notices it is made with lithomancy, the dwarven stone-shaping magic, and that the stone is very old. 
            </li>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <a href="party.html#Rasputin">Rasputin</a> tries to steal <a href="party.html#Un-Kell">Ün-Kell</a>'s horse from him, knowing only that it is on his person. Unbeknownst to <a href="party.html#Un-Kell">Ün-Kell</a>, <a href="party.html#Rasputin">Rasputin</a> starts pulling clothes out of <a href="party.html#Un-Kell">Ün-Kell</a>'s bag, but he can't find the horse. 
                </li> 
                <li> 
                    As we proceed through the tunnel, <a href="party.html#Multimodal">Multimodal</a> determines the tunnel is heading toward Orzho Bastion. <a href="party.html#L">"L"</a> sends Bob ahead to scout and determine whether the other end of the tunnel is safe. He scouts ahead and comes against the end of the tunnel, which is more stone. <a href="party.html#Nassirra">Nassirra</a> joins Bob and investigates the area. It's clear to her that the tunnel is not used much, but there is a door. She drags a claw along it and realizes she's on the other side of a brick wall. She heads back to the group and tells us that she's found a hidden door. We decide to briefly rest before trying the door, just in case we're not welcome on the other side. 
                </li>
            </ul>
            <li>
                After we rest, we are woozy and poisoned from the smoky air. We formulate a plan. <a href="party.html#Nassirra">Nassirra</a> hangs back with the rest of the group, keeping them cloaked in stealth, and <a href="party.html#Multimodal">Multimodal</a> opens the door, then uses her Firbolg magic to turn invisible in case there are enemies on the other side of the door. She finds a semi-rounded room with a pillar in the center and a staircase. There is a door on the other side of the room. She sees no one in the room, and so gives the "all clear" signal to the rest of the party. 
            </li>

<h3 id="Under the Bastion">Under the Bastion</h3>
<ul>
    <li>
        Everyone pours out of the tunnel as quietly as possible and gets a breath of clean air. We realize we might be in the base of a guard tower. <a href="party.html#Nassirra">Nassirra</a> keeps vigilant for the sound of guards. She hears a distant commotion from the top of the stairwell, the sound of clashing weapons and armor, like combat. She listens at the door, but can't tell whether there is a sound coming from behind the door. She conveys this information to us with impressively clear hand gestures. 
    </li>
    <li>
        <a href="party.html#Zieg">Zieg</a> worries that the combat sounds could be an actual fight, not just training, and worries that someone might need our help. He quietly ascends the stairs to investigate while <a href="party.html#Nassirra">Nassirra</a> quietly protests his decision. The sound is consistent and though some people are yelling, there are no cries for help. <a href="party.html#Zieg">Zieg</a> suspects the knights are training and decides not to proceed further up the stairs.
    </li>
    <li> 
        <a href="party.html#Nassirra">Nassirra</a> tries the door, which does not appear to be locked. It makes a very small popping sound as she cracks the door open slightly. She quickly gestures to the rest of the group to make sure everyone is on board with proceeding through the door, and we affirm that we are. She quietly opens the door into a hallway, only to find there is someone on the other side.
    </li>
    <ul>
        <li> 
            We hear a voice call out "Hey, is it shift change already?" and <a href="party.html#Nassirra">Nassirra</a> attempts to fool them, saying "Nah the boss just wanted me to check and make sure you weren't sleeping". 
        </li>
        <li>
            While this is happening, <a href="party.html#Rasputin">Rasputin</a> tries to steal the tiny horse from <a href="party.html#Un-Kell">Ün-Kell</a> again. This time, <a href="party.html#Un-Kell">Ün-Kell</a> notices, and they lock eyes as <a href="party.html#Rasputin">Rasputin</a> starts pulling a torch out of his bag. <a href="party.html#Rasputin">Rasputin</a> tucks the torch into <a href="party.html#Un-Kell">Ün-Kell</a>'s belt, pats him on the shoulder, and walks away. <a href="party.html#Un-Kell">Ün-Kell</a> can tell <a href="party.html#Rasputin">Rasputin</a> was caught red-handed, but he doesn't know what. He assumes <a href="party.html#Rasputin">Rasputin</a> actually wanted the torch. <a href="party.html#Rasputin">Rasputin</a> gives him a tinder box and makes finger guns to try and make peace. <a href="party.html#Un-Kell">Ün-Kell</a> deoesn't know what to make of the gesture.
        </li>
        <li>
            We go through the door as the knight on the other side gets increasingly suspicious, and <a href="party.html#Multimodal">Multimodal</a> magically charms her. She agrees to escort us around the Bastion and to vouch for us. She's been stationed outside the dungeon to stand guard. She vouches for us with the person guarding the dungeon itself. 
        </li>
        <li>
            <a href="party.html#Un-Kell">Ün-Kell</a> tries to stay far away from <a href="party.html#Rasputin">Rasputin</a>, clutching his torch close to his chest. <a href="party.html#Rasputin">Rasputin</a> tries to put his arm around <a href="party.html#Un-Kell">Ün-Kell</a> in a gesture of goodwill, but <a href="party.html#Un-Kell">Ün-Kell</a> walks away.
        </li>

        <li>
            The guard leads us from door to door, and we peer into each of them, feigning that we are searching for someone in particular. <a href="party.html#L">"L"</a> asks whether he has a list of the prisoners that we could check over to make the process easier, investigating as we go.
        </li>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <a href="party.html#Nassirra">Nassirra</a> notices another wooden door on the left side, and an additional door on the right that doesn't quite fit the cell layout. <a href="party.html#L">"L"</a> keeps the guard distracted with bureaucratic nonsense while <a href="party.html#Nassirra">Nassirra</a> peers into the cell that doesn't quite line up with the others. It lacks the usual furniture of the other cells, which makes <a href="party.html#Nassirra">Nassirra</a> suspicious. 
            </li>
            <li>
                <a href="party.html#Un-Kell">Ün-Kell</a>, out of the guard's line of sight, stealthily checks whether the door on the left is unlocked, and it is. He can hear there is someone on the other side.

                <a href="party.html#Nassirra">Nassirra</a> successfully picks the lock as <a href="party.html#L">"L"</a>'s distraction is taking place, and carefully opens the door a crack. It squeaks as it opens, attracting the guard's attention. <a href="party.html#Multimodal">Multimodal</a> starts banging on a nearby cell door to trick the guard about the source of the spell. The guard rushes up to <a href="party.html#Multimodal">Multimodal</a>, and as he does, <a href="party.html#Zieg">Zieg</a> casts silence, and <a href="party.html#Un-Kell">Ün-Kell</a> knocks the guard unconscious, after which <a href="party.html#Zieg">Zieg</a> drops the silence effect. <a href="party.html#L">"L"</a> pretends to continue talking to the guard so as to not raise suspicion. <a href="party.html#Rasputin">Rasputin</a> takes the keys from the guard and slips the keys into <a href="party.html#Un-Kell">Ün-Kell</a>'s bag without him noticing.

He drags the guard into an empty cell and locks him inside. <a href="party.html#Rasputin">Rasputin</a> gaslights <a href="party.html#Un-Kell">Ün-Kell</a> about the shirt and the keys, tries to convince him that he orchestrated the whole thing and just doesn't remember.

                <a href="party.html#Nassirra">Nassirra</a> investigates the cell further and finds a secret door in the cell. She opens the door. We pour into the hidden room through the false door.There is a luxurious purple rug in the room and there are candelabras on the wall. On the far side of the wall there's a wooden door. <a href="party.html#Un-Kell">Ün-Kell</a> listens to see whether there is any sound on the other side of the door. <a href="party.html#Nassirra">Nassirra</a> tests the door to see whether it's locked, and it opens. She stealthily pokes her head out of the door and sees a hallway with several doors along it, and no guards in sight.

Behind the statue there is a grate on the ground. <a href="party.html#Zieg">Zieg</a> enchants a coin with light and tosses it down the grate. He sees a room below, and intuits that the statue could be moved to reveal a secret passage to the lower level. The rest of the party gathers around. <a href="party.html#Rasputin">Rasputin</a> cuts himself with one of the torture implements he grabbed from the Riovanne's House, lets the blood drip into the basin, and the statue slowly moves, revealing stairs that lead downward. </span>

    <li>With <a href="party.html#Rasputin">Rasputin</a> leading the way, the party descends the stairs. At the bottom of the stairwell, the party notices stone channels along the wall that appear to be some form of plumbing, carrying water elsewhere. We find a door that leads to a large, open hallway, with several pillars in the center, that is long and appears to have several doors. It is lined with the same channels we saw at the bottom of the stairs. We don't see anyone there, and so we proceed into the hall. Before leaving the stairwell, <a href="party.html#Rasputin">Rasputin</a> attempts to disrupt the stones in the channels, and drops caltrops on the ground in case we are followed. After rejoining in the hallway, we decide to split up and explore the adjoining areas. </li>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="party.html#Multimodal">Multimodal</a> carefully opens a door on the western side of the hallway, roughly across from the stairs. The door reveals another, smaller hallway with doors to the north, south, and west. <a href="party.html#Rasputin">Rasputin</a> joins <a href="party.html#Multimodal">Multimodal</a> and decides to explore the door heading north while she investigates the door to the south. <a href="party.html#Rasputin">Rasputin</a> discovers another hallway heading north, lined with what appear to be cells. <a href="party.html#Multimodal">Multimodal</a> finds a small room lined with channels. At its center is what appears to be a wooden restraint block. She infers that this is a place where human sacrifices are bled to feed vampires.</li>
        <li>
            <a href="party.html#Zieg">Zieg</a> and <a href="party.html#Nassirra">Nassirra</a> explore another door on the west side of the main hallway, further north than the one <a href="party.html#Multimodal">Multimodal</a> opened. They find another small hallway and an adjoining room containing eight coffins inside.

        </li>
        <li>
            <a href="party.html#Un-Kell">Ün-Kell</a> sees something out of the corner of his eye and heads toward it, going north in the main hallway. <a href="party.html#L">"L"</a> starts exploring along the eastern wall of the hallway, slowly.  
        </li>
        <li>
            <span class="combat">Blood from the channels amasses to form a blood elemental in front of <a href="party.html#Multimodal">Multimodal</a>'s eyes. She is able to dispel the magic that caused the creature to form and thus dissolve it. She senses that something terrible is happening, and leaves the room to rejoin the others. Suddenly, from the northern doorway in the main hallway, <a href="npcs.html#Kont">Artorious Kont</a> appears. He turns to <a href="party.html#Un-Kell">Ün-Kell</a> and successfully persuades him that they are fighting on the same side. A group of lesser vampires emerge from the coffins and surprise <a href="party.html#Zieg">Zieg</a> and <a href="party.html#Nassirra">Nassirra</a>. The lesser vampires descend upon <a href="party.html#Zieg">Zieg</a>, wounding him badly, and sapping his lifeforce in the process. He retaliates with a burst of radiant energy that kills one of the vampires and badly wounds the others. <a href="party.html#Nassirra">Nassirra</a> strikes the remaining vampires frantically with her swords. Several other lesser vampires emerge from a hallway to the east and set their sights on <a href="party.html#L">"L"</a>. <a href="npcs.html#Kont">Artorious</a> then positions himself to attack <a href="party.html#L">"L"</a>. As <a href="party.html#Multimodal">Multimodal</a> makes her way back to the main hallway, another blood elemental appears, draining life from her. <a href="party.html#Rasputin">Rasputin</a> emerges from the hallway to the north and tries to attack the golem, but it proves difficult to hit. <a href="party.html#Multimodal">Multimodal</a> is able to get away from the golem, and runs into the main hallway. When she sees <a href="party.html#L">"L"</a> surrounded on all sides by vampires, she runs over to help. <a href="party.html#Un-Kell">Ün-Kell</a>, seeing his "friend" <a href="npcs.html#Kont">Artorious</a> charge after his other friends, grapples <a href="npcs.html#Kont">Artorious</a> to try and stop him from harming them, but <a href="npcs.html#Kont">Artorious</a> turns into a blood mist and evades <a href="party.html#Un-Kell">Ün-Kell</a>'s grasp. <a href="npcs.html#Kont">Artorious</a> lunges at <a href="party.html#L">"L"</a>, and <a href="party.html#Multimodal">Multimodal</a> jumps in the way to deflect the attack. <a href="party.html#L">"L"</a> invokes the defensive magic of the Glasstaff to protect hismelf. He launches repelling blasts at <a href="npcs.html#Kont">Artorious</a>, knocking him back into <a href="party.html#Un-Kell">Ün-Kell</a>, who grapples <a href="npcs.html#Kont">Kont</a> once more. <a href="npcs.html#Kont">Kont</a> again disencorporates into a blood mist to evade <a href="party.html#Un-Kell">Ün-Kell</a>'s grasp. </span>

        <li>
            <span class="combat"><a href="party.html#Nassirra">Nassirra</a> continues slashing at the lesser vampires attacking her and <a href="party.html#Zieg">Zieg</a>. She is able to wound them, but they are also able to sap life from them. <a href="party.html#Zieg">Zieg</a> calls upon Pelor and summons a powerful light that empowers his companions against the vampires. <a href="party.html#Rasputin">Rasputin</a> senses the severity of the situation, struggling to strike the blood elemental in front of him and hearing the sounds of battle echo from all sides around him, he decides to use the magic imbued in his throwing star. Once he does so, he emanates magical energy that allows him to pass through walls and emit harmful radiant energy against any creature in his path. Using its magic, he runs through the blood elemental, the lesser vampires, and finds himself face to face with <a href="npcs.html#Kont">Artorious Kont</a>. As he passes <a href="party.html#Zieg">Zieg</a>, who is wounded, he tosses a greater healing potion to him. He pounds his fist into the lesser vampires around him, who turn in terror. <a href="party.html#Un-Kell">Ün-Kell</a> is also suddenly terrified of <a href="party.html#Rasputin">Rasputin</a>, though he does not fully understand why. <a href="npcs.html#Kont">Artorious</a> strikes <a href="party.html#Rasputin">Rasputin</a>, who manages to resist much of the damage, and addresses him as "Master". We realize that <a href="npcs.html#Kont">Kont</a> was not trying to stop <a href="lore.html#Orcus">Orcus</a> at all, but wants to help bring him to the material plane, at the cost of our friend. <a href="party.html#Multimodal">Multimodal</a> tries to impede <a href="npcs.html#Kont">Artorious</a> with a flurry of radiant energy, but misses. <a href="party.html#Zieg">Zieg</a> beckons powerful spirit guardians to his aid, who destroy the vampires around him, along with <a href="party.html#Nassirra">Nassirra</a>. While our energies are largely focused on the vampires, the blood elemental engorges on blood, and grows in size. <a href="party.html#Un-Kell">Ün-Kell</a> turns to fight the blood elemental, his most unambiguous foe on the field. As he does, the golem engulfs him and <a href="party.html#L">"L"</a>. As the golem drained life force from both of them, <a href="party.html#Un-Kell">Ün-Kell</a> suddenly shook <a href="npcs.html#Kont">Kont</a>'s influence over him, and realized he must destroy <a href="npcs.html#Kont">Kont</a> and all of the other vampires. <a href="party.html#L">"L"</a> fired a repelling blast at the blood elemental from inside it, which launched the elemental away from him and freed both he and <a href="party.html#Un-Kell">Ün-Kell</a> from its body. </span>

            <span class="combat"><a href="party.html#Nassirra">Nassirra</a> and <a href="party.html#Zieg">Zieg</a>'s spirit guardians dispatch of the other lesser vampires. <a href="party.html#Un-Kell">Ün-Kell</a> reduces the blood elemental to a bloody pulp—literally—with his greatsword. As the group turns its attention on the battle between <a href="party.html#Rasputin">Rasputin</a> and <a href="npcs.html#Kont">Kont</a>, <a href="party.html#Rasputin">Rasputin</a> falls under <a href="npcs.html#Kont">Kont</a>'s warhammer, losing consciousness. <a href="npcs.html#Kont">Kont</a> then flies over <a href="party.html#Rasputin">Rasputin</a> and attacks <a href="party.html#Zieg">Zieg</a>. <a href="party.html#Zieg">Zieg</a>'s spirit guardians attack <a href="npcs.html#Kont">Kont</a>, but the damage has little effect, and <a href="party.html#Zieg">Zieg</a> suddenly realizes that <a href="npcs.html#Kont">Kont</a>'s cloak has been protecting him from radiant damage that would otherwise be fatal to undead. <a href="party.html#Nassirra">Nassirra</a> uses her vines to throw her swords at <a href="npcs.html#Kont">Kont</a>. <a href="party.html#Multimodal">Multimodal</a> cures <a href="party.html#Zieg">Zieg</a>'s wounds, and then ducks around the wall so her allies have better line of attack. <a href="party.html#L">"L"</a> launches repelling blasts at <a href="npcs.html#Kont">Kont</a>, knocking him backwards, and subjecting him to the magical effect still emanating from an unconscious <a href="party.html#Rasputin">Rasputin</a> in the process. <a href="party.html#Un-Kell">Ün-Kell</a>, furious with <a href="npcs.html#Kont">Kont</a>, drives his greatsword into him with great force. <a href="npcs.html#Kont">Kont</a> realizes the tides of the battle have turned against him, and disengages from the battle, fleeing through a door at the end of the hall, transforming into mist, and heading north. <a href="party.html#Nassirra">Nassirra</a> pursues him and manages to track him with hunter's mark as he uses the channels along the wall to travel to an interior room. <a href="party.html#Multimodal">Multimodal</a> runs to a door on the northeast side and finds him in the hallway. <a href="party.html#L">"L"</a> summons demonic forces to grab at <a href="npcs.html#Kont">Kont</a>, striking him. <a href="party.html#Un-Kell">Ün-Kell</a> pursues <a href="npcs.html#Kont">Kont</a> from the other side of the hallway, cutting him off at the pass. Suddenly, <a href="npcs.html#Kont">Kont</a>, in his blood mist form, escapes through a grate in the ceiling.</span> The party resigns itself to a somewhat unsatisfying victory.</span>
        </li>
    </ul>
        <li>
            <span id="08/15/2020">The party continues to explore <a href="npcs.html#Kont">Artorious</a>' secret lair. <a href="party.html#Nassirra">Nassirra</a> and <a href="party.html#L">"L"</a> notice a locked door not far from the hallway where <a href="npcs.html#Kont">Artorious</a> escaped. When <a href="party.html#Nassirra">Nassirra</a> attempts to pick the lock, it sets off an icy trap that sends a chill through both of them. <a href="party.html#Multimodal">Multimodal</a> realizes what's happening just in time to protect <a href="party.html#L">"L"</a> from the worst of the trap, then heals both <a href="party.html#Nassirra">Nassirra</a> and <a href="party.html#L">"L"</a>'s wounds. <a href="party.html#Un-Kell">Ün-Kell</a> then successfully breaks down the door.  
        </li>
        <ul>
            <li>Inside, we find a bedroom with women's finery in the closets and old oil paintings on the wall. None of us recognize the people depicted in the paintings. We suspect <a href="npcs.html#Kont">Kont</a> may have kept his wife there, or another woman, as prisoner, though we no longer trust a word he has said to us. There is what we presume to be a mirror hanging on the wall near the door, covered in cloth. <a href="party.html#Multimodal">Multimodal</a> carefully begins to investigate the mirror, but <a href="party.html#L">"L"</a> stops her, realizing the mirror is a soul-trapping mirror. <a href="party.html#Rasputin">Rasputin</a> defiles the bed and floor, as he is wont to do, by urinating on them. He removes the mirror from the wall, places it face down on the floor, and defecates on it. 
            </li>
        </ul>
        <li>We explore a room to the south of the locked room and reveal another crypt, full of coffins. Some are empty and clearly had been inhabited by some of the vampire thralls we encountered in battle, but others contain corpses still, adorned with very old and rusted Lucavi armor. <a href="party.html#Zieg">Zieg</a> casts sacred flame on each of the corpses to cleanse the crypt. As he does, he notices some spiritual force leave the bodies, as though a soul were still attached to them, which is rather unusual for an unintelligent, undead creature. </li>
        <li>We then move on to explore the western part of the lair further. <a href="party.html#Nassirra">Nassirra</a> finds a small closet of some kind in the northwest corner with a channel that continues beyond the walkable space of the closet, and appears to be clogged in some way. Further south, the party discovers a large room with another large reservoir, similar to the one <a href="party.html#Multimodal">Multimodal</a> encountered before the battle, only this one contains a pool of congealed, pulsating blood. It appears to be alive in some way, but does not appear to be an active threat to the party.</li>
        <li>Just north of the reservoir chamber, <a href="party.html#Nassirra">Nassirra</a> notices a grate on the ceiling leading to an upper level of the keep. She is unable to open it from below, but sees some kind of handle on the other side that could be used to lift the grate up. <a href="party.html#Multimodal">Multimodal</a> transforms into a blink dog and teleports above the grate, where she is able to lift the grate with her teeth. Though the space is cramped, everyone is able to fit, and we ascend further, until we reach a wooden trap door with some holes in it. <a href="party.html#Un-Kell">Ün-Kell</a> tries to lift it, but meets resistance. </li>
        <ul>
            <li>
                As <a href="party.html#Multimodal">Multimodal</a> prepares to again teleport up to the next level and see whether she can open the door, she hears a sound, and signals to the others to stay silent. Because she is a dog, they don't exactly understand what she's trying to convey, but they get the gist. She listens carefully and hears two guards discussing a newly announced security drill of some kind. One of the guards is puzzled by the call for a drill, and skeptical as to what it's really about. The other guard is just concerned with following orders. After <a href="party.html#Multimodal">Multimodal</a> hears them walk away, she breaks from wild shape and tells her companions what she heard. 
            </li>
            <li>
                She then returns to her blink dog form and teleports above the wooden door to find she is on a stone rampart. She sees chains coming from the rampart and a padlock in place securing the door closed. She returns to her firbolg form and looses a thorn whip, catching the chains in vines and using torque to break them from the door, unlocking it for her companions, but making a loud sound. The rest of the party then climbs out through the door. We decide to jump over the wall using a rope and camp outside of Lucav, which no longer feels safe to us. As <a href="party.html#Rasputin">Rasputin</a> prepares to descend the wall, he tosses a force egg toward the bastion and detonates it to create a diversion.
            </li>

<h3 id="The Lucavi Fugitives">The Lucavi Fugitives</h3>

    <li>
        We find a place to hide west of Lucav and make camp, during which time we get some much needed rest. <a href="party.html#L">"L"</a> summons a new incarnation of his familiar, Bob, an owl that makes walrus sounds. <a href="party.html#L">"L"</a> performs a ritual that allows him to understand languages otherwise unknown to him, and reads the letter he was unable to read in <a href="npcs.html#Kont">Artorious</a>' office. It is written in abyssal script. In the letters, <a href="npcs.html#Kont">Artorious</a> corresponds with someone who he refers to as his father, and who in turn refers to <a href="npcs.html#Kont">Artorious</a> as his son. <a href="party.html#L">"L"</a> learns that <a href="npcs.html#Kont">Artorious</a> lied to us about more than we initially thought. He lied about the history of <a href="lore.html#Orcus">Orcus</a>' vessel and cycle, that <a href="party.html#Rasputin">Rasputin</a> is the first such vessel to come along in quite a long time. He shares what he has learned with the group, and we realize that we need to protect <a href="party.html#Rasputin">Rasputin</a> from <a href="npcs.html#Kont">Artorious</a> at all costs. <a href="npcs.html#Kont">Artorious</a> will come after him by whatever means necessary. By very early morning, we feel rejuvenated and begin to plan our next moves. At some point, ominous whispers emanate from the tiny horse, which further ignite <a href="party.html#Un-Kell">Ün-Kell</a>'s reverence for the tiny horse. We decide to go after the necromancer in hopes of gaining more intelligence about the situation. It's unclear whether the necromancer might be allied with <a href="npcs.html#Kont">Artorious</a> or at the very least associated with him in some way. Before we do, we decide to inform someone we know in the Lucavi knights about what <a href="npcs.html#Kont">Artorious</a> is, and the damning evidence we found in his lair. <a href="party.html#Zieg">Zieg</a> reaches out to Lucia, who we feel we can trust as much as anyone in the organization, to tell her that we have disturbing news about undead among the Lucavi Knights, and can provide proof. <a href="party.html#Zieg">Zieg</a> asks her to meet us north of town, along the river, to discuss further. She responds in the affirmative.

    <ul>
        <li>We wait hours for Lucia to appear. Bob surveils the road south from the sky. <a href="party.html#Zieg">Zieg</a> and <a href="party.html#L">"L"</a> wait out in the open, along the river. <a href="party.html#Multimodal">Multimodal</a> and <a href="party.html#Rasputin">Rasputin</a> assemble a camoflage shelter away from the road to watch unseen. <a href="party.html#Multimodal">Multimodal</a> carves a second tiny horse to give to <a href="party.html#Un-Kell">Ün-Kell</a>, but the quality is very poor. She proudly presents it to <a href="party.html#Un-Kell">Ün-Kell</a> anyway and he accepts it, appreciating the spirit of the gift if not the gift itself. Eventually, Bob reports to <a href="party.html#L">"L"</a> that five people are approaching. When they get close enough, <a href="party.html#L">"L"</a> and <a href="party.html#Zieg">Zieg</a> recognize one of them to be Lucia, and the others appear to be lesser-ranked knights.</li>
        <li>Lucia expresses reservations about coming to the meeting, but wants to hear what we have to say. She comments on how few members of the party she sees, at which point <a href="party.html#Nassirra">Nassirra</a> and <a href="party.html#Un-Kell">Ün-Kell</a> make themselves known, and attempt to further persuade Lucia with their own accounts of what happened. <a href="party.html#Zieg">Zieg</a> assures her that we only hid to take reasonable precautions and mean her no harm. <a href="party.html#Multimodal">Multimodal</a> and <a href="party.html#Rasputin">Rasputin</a> stay hidden. </li>
        <li><a href="party.html#L">"L"</a> walks Lucia through the evidence we've obtained about <a href="npcs.html#Kont">Artorious</a>' true nature, his vampirism, and his involvement in sinister plots detailed in the letter. She remains skeptical, but continues to listen, asking questions throughout. She says <a href="npcs.html#Kont">Artorious</a> saved her life, and she would be reluctant to turn against him. When <a href="party.html#L">"L"</a> tells her about the Riovannes house, the secret passage to the bastion, and the attempt to trap and kill us by setting the house ablaze with us inside of it, she gives us the story that was told to the Lucavi Knights, that the house was set fire for the safety of the town, because we had failed. Our continued existence contradicted that particular lie. She also tells us that her light blade, along with the other Lucavi Knights' blades, have stopped working. <a href="party.html#Zieg">Zieg</a> wonders to himself whether cleansing the crypt beneath the bastion might have caused that to happen. <a href="party.html#Zieg">Zieg</a> contributes his own observations about <a href="npcs.html#Kont">Artorious</a> that he divined through magical means.
        </li>
        <li> In the face of indisputible evidence, Lucia removes her glove and reveals a vampire's bite wound on her arm. We realize she knew about <a href="npcs.html#Kont">Artorious</a> all along. She does express concern that we were able to uncover the secret so easily, having met <a href="npcs.html#Kont">Artorious</a> only a day or two prior. She argues that the fact that he is a vampire doesn't mean he can't also be good, the same story <a href="npcs.html#Kont">Artorious</a> tried to sell us on when we first met. Her knights look alarmed—they had not known about <a href="npcs.html#Kont">Artorious</a> and she just confirmed our story. <a href="party.html#L">"L"</a> pushes back on that point, explaning that <a href="npcs.html#Kont">Artorious</a> is not good because he is planning to bring <a href="lore.html#Orcus">Orcus</a>, an evil demon lord, to the material plane, and to kill innocent people in the process. The argument sows some doubt in Lucia, but she wants to do her own research to verify our claims. Her knights express concern, having learned their leader is a vampire. She confesses that she and other Lucavi exalts were dispatched to find us and bring us back to the bastion as prisoners, and while she will let us go free, she can't return empty handed. She asks us where we camped the night before and we tell her, so she can find some evidence of our encampment and escape to bring back with her. She sets off to the direction of the camp, to the southwest, and we ready ourselves to find the necromancer.</span></li>

        We head north following the shuffling tracks left by undead. We find ourselves in a field devoid of vegetation, with no cover to protect us from prying eyes. Eventually we see a pillar made of bone like the ones <a href="npcs.html#Kont">Kont</a> warned us about. Circling the pillar are flying creatures of some kind that appear to be guarding something. <a href="party.html#L">"L"</a> sends his familiar Bobrus III to cautiously investigate. Shortly thereafter, Bob returns with one of the flying creatures in pursuit before breaking off and returning to the pillar. Bob is unable to give a detailed description, but conveys to <a href="party.html#L">"L"</a> that it is a large skeletal flying creature, many times his size. As the party heads toward the pillar, we notice a large dragon skull surrounding the opening of cavern of some kind, which we assume is the entrance to the necromancer's lair. As we approach, three flying skeletal dragons meet us.
        <ul>
            <li><span class="combat"><a href="party.html#Rasputin">Rasputin</a> launches his ninja star at one of the dragons, but misses. <a href="party.html#Multimodal">Multimodal</a> successfully lights another dragon with radiant energy. In response, the dragon swoops down toward a nearby <a href="party.html#Un-Kell">Ün-Kell</a> and launches a battery of attacks against him. A second dragon attacks both <a href="party.html#Un-Kell">Ün-Kell</a> and <a href="party.html#Rasputin">Rasputin</a>, and the third descends on <a href="party.html#Nassirra">Nassirra</a>. <a href="party.html#Nassirra">Nassirra</a>, <a href="party.html#L">"L"</a>, and <a href="party.html#Zieg">Zieg</a> swiftly dispatch with the latter skeletal dragon before it can attack anyone. Dark energy overcomes <a href="party.html#Rasputin">Rasputin</a> and he slays both the dragon that attacked him and the other remaining dragon. 
            </li>
        </ul></span>
        <li>
            East of the entrance, we discover a large pile of ash. <a href="party.html#Rasputin">Rasputin</a> prods it with his staff and finds a denser core of ash, suggesting the pile has been there a long time, and the older ashes toward the center have compacted with time. We enter the dragon skull mouth and find a large hall adorned with crafted bone, and an effigy of <a href="lore.html#Orcus">Orcus</a>. The wear on the floor indicates the statue has been worshipped. We come upon a junction that breaks to the left and right. From the left, we can hear wet dripping sounds; from the right, there seems to be some kind of faint light. <a href="party.html#Rasputin">Rasputin</a> detects the presence of evil creatures coming from that direction. We decide to head toward the light and walk into an ambush.  
        </li>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <span class="combat">We encounter four reanimated humanoid skeletons in a corridor: two wielding bows, one with a sword and shield, and the final, most intimidating foe wields a staff made of bone. <a href="party.html#Un-Kell">Ün-Kell</a> runs toward a skeleton bearing a shield and hurls a javelin at it. We dispatch the shield-bearer with relative ease. <a href="party.html#Rasputin">Rasputin</a> charges up to the staff-wielding skeleton and throws a barrage of punches into it. <a href="party.html#Nassirra">Nassirra</a> uses vines to launch her short swords towards one of the bow-wielding skeletons after it ducks back into an alcove for cover. The staff-wielding skeleton raises its hands to cast a spell, but <a href="party.html#L">"L"</a> counters the spell with one of his own. He then sends Bob to torment the skeleton, leaving it vulnerable to future attack. <a href="party.html#Zieg">Zieg</a> hurls a bolt of radiant energy at the spellcasting skeleton, injuring it gravely. <a href="party.html#Un-Kell">Ün-Kell</a> charges toward it and attacks with his greatsword, slaying the creature. <a href="party.html#Nassirra">Nassirra</a> and <a href="party.html#L">"L"</a> hurl ranged attacks and Eldritch blasts at the remaining skeletons, destroying them.</span>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <li>
            The corridor we were ambushed in branches off to the right and left once more. From the right, there is a colorful, shimmering light, and <a href="party.html#Rasputin">Rasputin</a> can see a child sitting in front of the light, staring. As he approaches, he realizes there are other kids there, all sitting around a pool of shimmering light, staring at it. <a href="party.html#Rasputin">Rasputin</a> and <a href="party.html#Multimodal">Multimodal</a> enter the room, and become entranced by the shimmering light themselves, bodies going slack as they do. <a href="party.html#L">"L"</a> notices something is off with them and suspects the light may have hypnotized them somehow. He sends Bob in to carefully try and snap us out of it while avoiding looking at the light himself. Bob scratches at <a href="party.html#Multimodal">Multimodal</a> until she wakes from her stupor. She realizes the light is a glimmerpool, fey hynotic magic, and destroys it with several blows from her staff. <a href="party.html#Rasputin">Rasputin</a> and the children regain control of themselves. 
        </li>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <a href="party.html#Multimodal">Multimodal</a>, <a href="party.html#Rasputin">Rasputin</a>, and <a href="party.html#L">"L"</a> talk to the children. We learn that they were taken from Lilygrove by someone who they call "the bone lady". They do not remember anything between when they arrived in the cavern and the moment the glimmerpool was destroyed. We can tell that they have gone without food and have been sitting around the glimmerpool for days. <a href="party.html#Multimodal">Multimodal</a> and <a href="party.html#Zieg">Zieg</a> tend to their wounds, and we share our rations with them. <a href="party.html#Multimodal">Multimodal</a> and <a href="party.html#L">"L"</a> decide we can't leave the kids behind. <a href="party.html#Multimodal">Multimodal</a> pulls out a rope and asks them all to hold on to it, promising that we will keep them safe. <a href="party.html#Multimodal">Multimodal</a> and <a href="party.html#L">"L"</a> stay behind the children as we proceed further into the lair.
            </li> 
        </ul>
        <li>
            After leaving the glimmerpool room, we turn right down the unexplored passage and come to a junction of three possible paths. One is a door, another is some kind of humanmade tunnel, and the other looks like natural stone. <a href="party.html#Rasputin">Rasputin</a> listens to the door and hears some faint, rhythmic sound that he can't quite localize or place. 
        </li>
        <ul>
            <li>
                We open the door and find a long hallway with two doors, one on the right wall and the other on the left. The door on the right is comprised of metal bars, and contains jail cells that appear to have been occupied recently. The kids get scared, and <a href="party.html#Zieg">Zieg</a> reassures them that we'll keep them safe. We return to the main room. 
            </li>
            <li>
                The other door, on the left, leads to a large room containing an incinerator like the one we saw in the Riovannes house. The incinerator contains some ash remnants, and we see some discarded clothes nearby. <a href="party.html#Multimodal">Multimodal</a> realizes the ash in the incinerator is connected to the ash pile we encountered outside the entrance, and concludes they must be incinerating bodies inside the cavern for some reason and dumping the ash outside. 
            </li>
            <li>
                After exploring the room thoroughly, we return back to the junction, and we decide to take the humanmade tunnel. 
            </li>
        </ul>
        <li>
            We enter a room furnished with over-the-top, stereotypically goth decor, such as raven's feathers. The rhythmic sounds we heard before are much louder, with added layers, initially sounding like screams, but as we approach we realize we're hearing strange melodies sung in different languages coming from behind a door. <a href="party.html#Rasputin">Rasputin</a> opens the door and realizes the source of the sound is much louder than it seemed from the other side. We enter a large room with a raised stage and stadium-like seating. On the stage we see four humanoids that appear to form a band, playing music together: a human singer, an ashen pan floutist, a dwarven drummer, and an elven bassist. On the back of the stage behind them we can see a restrained, unconscious child. The lead singer of this apparent band greets us, and proclaims that they has been expecting us, singling out <a href="party.html#Rasputin">Rasputin</a>. We ask what they're doing with the child, and they give evasive reponses, dodging the question. <a href="party.html#Rasputin">Rasputin</a> asks them point blank if they're followers of Orcus, and the ashen woman confirms that they are. We prepare for combat.
