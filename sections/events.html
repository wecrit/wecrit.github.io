<ul>
    <li>Went to town, stayed in a tavern, got drunk, saw a dragon footprint, measured it with <a href="party.html#Rasputin">Rasputin</a>.</li>
    <li>The dragon attacked livestock on a halfling’s farm (Qelline).</li>
    <li>When we reminded her (by asking) that she had a kid, she ran home to her farm to check on said kid. We followed her there.</li>
    <ul>

<ul>
    <li>After buying goods and seeking information from Barthen, we prepared to resume adventuring.</li>
    <li><span class="combat">When we left, we were approached by a group of Redbrands, who told us to leave or there would be a fight. <a href="party.html#Un-Kell">Ün-Kell</a> approached the Redbrands, and combat ensued.

<h3><span id="Stone Hill Inn">Stone Hill Inn</span></h3>
<ul>
    <li>We brought our captive to the inn, where the innkeeper asked us not to keep him there, for fear of reprisal from more Redbrands.</li>

<h3>Edermath Orchard</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Barthen suggested Daren Edermath as a trustworthy person, who Barthen would like to see become townmaster.</li>
    <li>Daren was surprisingly cool about us showing up with an unconcious Redbrand. He allowed us to interrogate the bandit on his property.</li>
    <ul></span>
        <li><span id="04/16/2017">The bandit (who went by 'Red') reveals that there is a trap in the manor we must avoid, between the basement of the manor and a crypt.

His description of <a href="npcs.html#Glasstaff">Glasstaff</a> is consistent with <a href="npcs.html#Sildar">Sildar</a>'s description of <a href="npcs.html#Glasstaff">Lord Albrek</a>.</li>

    <li>Not much was going on until the people from a back room came rushing out.</li>

    <li>Made it across and through a room with a bunch of stone coffins.</li>
    <li>Found a jail where Mirna was with her children. She was accompanied by several men, who turned out to be Redbrands in disguise.</li>
    <li>Rescued them, then <span class="combat">jumped by Redbrands.</span></li>

         <li>We also find the corpse of an elf in the chasm, and fear it may once have been Mirna's husband.</li>
        </ul>
     <li>As we search the rest of the manor, we come upon a room containing Redbrands. They immediately surrender to us and beg us to spare them. Their apparent leader, Alethra, tells us that <a href="npcs.html#Glasstaff">Glasstaff</a> fled during our return trip to Phandalin. She and her comrades agree to provide us intel on his whereabouts in exchange for their lives, and for a lucrative reward (promised by <a href="party.html#Nassirra">Nassirra</a>).</li>
    <ul>
         <li>They agree to our terms, and show us to <a href="npcs.html#Glasstaff">Glasstaff</a>'s alchemy lab. The lab has been ransacked. In his private quarters we discover a secret passage leading to a room in the crypt. Alethra is disappointed that her mentor <a href="npcs.html#Glasstaff">Glasstaff</a> hid so much from her.</li>
    </ul>
     <li>Alethra and her friends tell us more about the orcs we seek, and where they take the slaves. She speaks of a path south of the manor, through the woods. We seek out the path.</li>

    <li> We follow a trail of blood and footprints (from humans, probably slaves). </li>
    <li> Along the trail we encounter some stone ruins. </li>
    <ul>
        <li>We camp north of the trail for the night.</li>

    <li> The group hears an indimidating yell in the distance, but only <a href="party.html#Multimodal">Multimodal</a> and <a href="party.html#Un-Kell">Ün-Kell</a> can understand it.

    <li> Zeig investigates the humanoid, which turns out to be <a href="https://southpark.fandom.com/wiki/ManBearPig_(character)">ManBearPig</a> (MBP)! </li>

        <li> We travel toward the keep for some time, then decide to find a place to camp for the night.</li>
        <li> In the morning, we decide our captive's name is Spike, and convince him to like it. (His real name was Gul'then).</li>

        <li> <span class="combat">The door opens, and we end up face-to-face with a goblin. A goblin ranger shoots an arrow at <a href="party.html#Rasputin">Rasputin</a>, but he deflects it and injures another goblin.</span></li>
        <li> <span class="combat">An elf-like creature joins the fight. As combat unfolds, the creature's skin changes, and we realize it is not an elf at all. <a href="party.html#Un-Kell">Ün-Kell</a> kills whatever it is.</span></li>
        <li> <span class="combat">King Grol, disturbed by the commotion, also joins the fight. He knocks <a href="party.html#Nassirra">Nassirra</a> unconcious.</span></li>
        <li> <span class="combat">As the party fights on, <a href="party.html#Multimodal">Multimodal</a> helps a wounded <a href="party.html#Nassirra">Nassirra</a> to rejoin the fray. <a href="party.html#Zieg">Zieg</a> attacks with a Pelor bomb, slaying King Grol and hurting his remaining allies.</span></li>
        <li> <span class="combat">The remaining two goblins attempt to escape through arrow slits in the tower, only to meet their demise.</span></li>
    </ul></span>
    <li> Spike marvels at us with newfound respect. <a href="party.html#Rasputin">Rasputin</a> gives him a gold piece as a reward for his services.</li>
    <li> We find an unconscious humanoid in the room, and discover that it is a wounded <a href="npcs.html#Rockseeker">Gundren</a>. A joyful reunion takes place. <a href="party.html#Zieg">Zieg</a> heals <a href="npcs.html#Rockseeker">Gundren</a>'s wounds and offers him a drink from his flask. When he empties it, <a href="party.html#Rasputin">Rasputin</a> offers him ale. We convince him not to kill Spike, who may continue to be useful.</li>
    <li>We learn that <a href="npcs.html#Rockseeker">Gundren</a> has a map to a mysterious lost mine, and that <a href="npcs.html#The Spider">Spider</a> will stop at nothing to take it from him. We find the map nearby in a leather bag, along with some coin and other valuables.</li>
    </span><li> <span id="01/13/2018"> <a href="party.html#Un-Kell">Ün-Kell</a>, <a href="party.html#Zieg">Zieg</a>, and <a href="party.html#L">"L"</a> investigate the hall southwest of the room where King Grol was slain. <a href="party.html#Zieg">Zieg</a> and <a href="party.html#L">"L"</a> can hear arguing in a room further south. <a href="party.html#Un-Kell">Ün-Kell</a> asks Spike what room is south of them, where the sound appears to be coming from. Spike replies that it's the kitchen. <a href="party.html#L">"L"</a> and <a href="party.html#Zieg">Zieg</a> decide to investigate. <a href="party.html#Multimodal">Multimodal</a> decides to folow, with <a href="npcs.html#Rockseeker">Gundren</a> in tow.</li>
    <ul>
        <li> As <a href="party.html#Un-Kell">Ün-Kell</a> and the gang approach the kitchen, the sounds of combat become increasingly noticeable. </li>
    </ul>
    <li> Meanwhile, <a href="party.html#Rasputin">Rasputin</a> decided to explore south east of King Grol's room. <a href="party.html#Nassirra">Nassirra</a> followed shortly thereafter.</li>
    <ul>
        <li> <a href="party.html#Nassirra">Nassirra</a> hears unsettling gurgling sounds coming from the south end of the building. Something seems to have noticed her presence. As it begins to ram itself against the wooden door separating the rooms, <a href="party.html#Nassirra">Nassirra</a> exits the room through the western door to regroup with the rest of the party. <a href="party.html#Rasputin">Rasputin</a> reluctantly follows. <a href="party.html#Rasputin">Rasputin</a> asks Spike what's behind the door and trying to escape. Spike says it is a creature that the goblins keep as a pet.</li>
    </ul>
    <li> The group moves further down the hall in the south west direction and encounters another door at the end of the hall way. <a href="party.html#Zieg">Zieg</a> decides to open it stealthily, and finds that the room is riddled with bloodied goblins and hobgoblins in various states of injury. He closes the door as the party decides what to do. </li>
    <li> Further north in the hallway is another door. <a href="party.html#Multimodal">Multimodal</a> listens to it and hears nothing. She then determines that the door is not locked, and carefully opens it. She discovers that the room has high vaulted ceilings, much higher than the other ceilings in the keep, and notices two serpentine figures in the rafters. She quietly closes the door and informs the others. When asked about them, Spike remarks that the creatures are also pets.</li>
    <ul>
        <li> The group debates setting a trap outside the kitchen door, where combat is obviously happening, but decides against it. Instead, the party forms a marching order with <a href="party.html#Un-Kell">Ün-Kell</a> in front and decides to engage whatever was lurking in the rafters. Before entering the room, <a href="party.html#Un-Kell">Ün-Kell</a> places a large rock on Spike's chain so that he can't escape, but also does not get caught in the fray. <a href="npcs.html#Rockseeker">Gundren</a> decides to recuperate in King Grol's chambers.</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
        <li> <span class="combat">The party pours into the room and catches the two serpents by surprise. <a href="party.html#Un-Kell">Ün-Kell</a> attempts to throw a javelin at one of them, and it hits, but does not wound it. <a href="party.html#Rasputin">Rasputin</a> and <a href="party.html#Nassirra">Nassirra</a> quickly discover that the monsters' stony hides are resistant to physical damage. </span></li>
        <li> <span class="combat"><a href="party.html#Zieg">Zieg</a> and <a href="party.html#L">"L"</a> are able to wound the creatures using damaging spells. <a href="party.html#Rasputin">Rasputin</a> and <a href="party.html#Un-Kell">Ün-Kell</a> ultimately are able to deal enough physical damage to the monsters, despite their stony hides. </span></li>
        <li> <span class="combat">The party dispatches the two monsters with relative ease.</span></li>
    </ul>
    <li> Spike took the opportunity to escape while the party was occupied. <a href="party.html#Zieg">Zieg</a> attempts to find him, to no avail. He takes the opportunity to check on <a href="npcs.html#Rockseeker">Gundren</a>, who is still safe, but has not seen Spike. <a href="party.html#Zieg">Zieg</a> then rejoins the party with <a href="npcs.html#Rockseeker">Gundren</a>.</li>
    <li> After combat, the party is able to investigate the room and determined that it is an old chapel. <a href="party.html#Nassirra">Nassirra</a> decides to explore further, and discovers an altar room, where two shadowy figures are hiding. The party also notices that the sounds coming from the kitchen have died down.</li>
    <li> The party separates. <a href="party.html#Un-Kell">Ün-Kell</a> explores a door on the south west side of the chapel. He carefully opens the door, and makes eye-contact with a hobgoblin on the other side. The hobgoblin and its goblin comrades prepare to fight.</li>
    <ul>
        <li> <span class="combat"><a href="party.html#Un-Kell">Ün-Kell</a> charges at the hobgoblin, and feels a strange tug on his leg, accompanied by an ominous clicking sound. Despite his attempt to jump away, he triggers a trap which causes the ceiling to collapse in a pile rubble. </span></li>
        <li> <span class="combat">The rubble pile is too high and unstable for the other party members to cross. <a href="party.html#Zieg">Zieg</a> attempts to clear the rubble, but does not succeed. He calls out for the other party members to help dig through the rubble.</span></li>
        <li> <span class="combat"><a href="party.html#Multimodal">Multimodal</a> shapeshifts into a large rat to cross the rubble. As a rat, she makes reassuring squeaking sounds in <a href="party.html#Un-Kell">Ün-Kell</a>'s direction, joined soon after by <a href="party.html#L">Bob</a>. She heals him and casts a spell to help protect him in battle. Eventually, <a href="party.html#Un-Kell">Ün-Kell</a> is able to defeat all but one of the surrounding goblins and the hobgoblin. The remaining goblin runs away in a northerly direction.</span></li>
    </ul>
    <li> <span class="combat">At the same time as <a href="party.html#Un-Kell">Ün-Kell</a> began combat with the hobgoblin, <a href="party.html#Nassirra">Nassirra</a> and <a href="party.html#L">"L"</a> engaged the goblins hiding behind the altar in the church.</span></li>
    <ul>
        <li> <span class="combat"><a href="party.html#Nassirra">Nassirra</a>, <a href="party.html#L">"L"</a>, and <a href="party.html#Rasputin">Rasputin</a> attack the goblins. <a href="party.html#Zieg">Zieg</a> comes to assist them after his attempt to clear the rubble. <a href="party.html#Zieg">Zieg</a> summoned a spiritual mace to aid in the fight. <a href="party.html#Rasputin">Rasputin</a> and <a href="party.html#Nassirra">Nassirra</a> deal killing blows to the two goblins, respectively.</span></li>
        <li> <span class="combat">Several hobgoblins then burst through the nearby door and attacked the group, but they were defeated with relative ease. One goblin survived&mdash;the one who fled from <a href="party.html#Un-Kell">Ün-Kell</a>&mdash;and was knocked unconscious.</span></li>
    </ul>
    <li> The party explores the rest of the keep and discovers several items of interest: a quarterstaff (The Black Feather), and longsword and mail armor bearing the crest of the Lords' Alliance. </li>
    <li> Finally, the party decides to investigate the grumbling sounds <a href="party.html#Nassirra">Nassirra</a> and <a href="party.html#Rasputin">Rasputin</a> heard earlier. They bring the unconscious goblin along in hopes that it may serve as bait for the creature. Once the goblin has been placed in front of the door, <a href="party.html#Zieg">Zieg</a> opens it and runs off.</li>
    <ul>
        <li> <span class="combat">All members of the party ready attacks for when the creature attempts to burst through the door. Due to the size of the creature, an owlbear, it remains trapped in a choke point and is defeated easily.</span></li>
        <li> <span class="combat">The party leaves the unconscious goblin face down in a pile of owlbear droppings, because we are terrible.</span></li>
        <ul>
            <li> We have a change of heart and decide to turn the goblin's head so that he doesn't suffocate in a poop puddle.</li>
        </ul>
    </ul>
    </span><li> <span id="02/03/2018"> After some final looting of corpses for valuables, the party leaves Cragmaw Keep to return <a href="npcs.html#Rockseeker">Gundren</a> to Phandalin.</li>
</ul>

<h2><span id="Gundren Returns to Phandalin">Gundren Returns to Phandalin</span></h2>
<ul>
    <li> The party travels west along the main road and marches on until nightfall. We find a boar to eat and give <a href="npcs.html#Rockseeker">Gundren</a> his first real meal in days.</li>
    <ul>
        <li> After eating some food, <a href="npcs.html#Rockseeker">Gundren</a>'s spirit returns and he tells us more about Wave Echo Cave. Nearly two weeks prior, he and his brothers followed the map, and at first found nothing. Then, they began to dig, until the ground opened up beneath them and revealed a tunnel. Though the tunnel was too dark to see into, <a href="npcs.html#Rockseeker">Gundren</a> knew it was the right place because he could hear the echoes of crashing waves. He had not seen his brothers since.</li>
        <li> We set up camp near an intersection and rest. <a href="party.html#Rasputin">Rasputin</a> takes the first watch of the night, followed by <a href="party.html#Zieg">Zieg</a>, and <a href="party.html#Nassirra">Nassirra</a> and <a href="party.html#Un-Kell">Ün-Kell</a> share the last watch.</li>
    </ul>
    <li> As the group approaches the familiar outer wall of the city, <a href="party.html#Rasputin">Rasputin</a> notices that something is amiss up ahead. A large group of people are standing on the road. Among them are men and women clad in plate armor, and bald men in flowing white robes. We recognize the armored folk as members of the Scarlet Vigil, and the men in white robes as members of the Silver Council. Together, they are Sentinels of the Spire, a group from Elspire charged with peacekeeping. </li>
    <li> We notice that the road leading to the Edermath Orchard is lined with prison carts. Suspiciously, the carts are attached to golems exactly like the golems the party encountered in the catacombs under Tresendar Manor.</li>
    <li> Before we can investigate further, we are approached by a member of the Scarlet Vigil, who asks about our business in Phandalin. We point to <a href="npcs.html#Rockseeker">Gundren</a> and explain that we have been escorting him back to the town. The guard is similarly vague about what the Sentinels of the Spire are doing in Phandalin. </li>
    <ul>
        <li> As we speak to the guard, a dragonborn member of the Scarlet Vigil approaches us, and introduces himself as Sir <a href="npcs.html#Razak">Razak</a> Guldarzadarian. He is displeased with our story and claims to have received reports from trusted sources that describe our party as disturbers of the peace in Phandalin. When we explain that some misunderstanding must have occurred, and that <a href="npcs.html#Sildar">Sildar</a> should be able to help clear things up, he escorts us to the Townmaster's Hall for further inquiry.</li>
    </ul>
</ul>

<h3><span id="Townmaster's Hall">Townmaster's Hall</span> </h3>
<ul>
    <li> In the Townmaster's Hall, we notice <a href="npcs.html#Sildar">Sildar</a> speaking to a cloaked and bearded man who we have not seen before. The man is wielding what appears to be a glass staff. The party immediately realizes that this is <a href="npcs.html#Glasstaff">Lord Albrek</a>, also known as <a href="npcs.html#Glasstaff">Glasstaff</a>. <a href="npcs.html#Sildar">Sildar</a> seems to be unaware that his companion is the leader of the Redbrands.</li>
    <li> <a href="npcs.html#Sildar">Sildar</a> sees <a href="npcs.html#Rockseeker">Gundren</a> and expresses genuine happiness and relief upon seeing his friend alive. <a href="npcs.html#Rockseeker">Gundren</a> wants to greet <a href="npcs.html#Sildar">Sildar</a>, but is stopped by a guard. Lord <a href="npcs.html#Razak">Razak</a> explains his suspicions and asks <a href="npcs.html#Sildar">Sildar</a> whether our account of events is true.</li>
    <ul>
        <li> <a href="npcs.html#Glasstaff">Lord Albrek</a> chimes in to say that our party fits what he claims to have seen before he "fled for his life". He claims that we murdered innocent citizens of Phandalin in cold blood.</li>
        <li> <a href="party.html#L">"L"</a> very convincingly explains that the so-called citizens were actually Redbrands, bandits who had been terrorizing the good people of Phandalin, and who attacked us unprovoked. We were simply defending ourselves.</li>
        <ul>
            <li> <a href="npcs.html#Sildar">Sildar</a> acknowledges that we killed the citizens, but adds that he believes our story about the altercation: that the "citizens" were indeed Redbrands who started the altercation in the first place, and we only acted in self defense. However, because he was not an eye witness to the event, he is unable to corroborate our story.</li>
        </ul>
        <li> Lord <a href="npcs.html#Razak">Razak</a> asks whether we have witnesses who can confirm our story. We volunteer the blacksmith, Baerin Lodesoot, and the woman we rescued from Tresendar Manor, Mirna. <a href="npcs.html#Sildar">Sildar</a> leaves to find the witnesses and bring them back to the Townmaster's Hall for questioning.</li>
        <li> When <a href="npcs.html#Sildar">Sildar</a> returns with the witnesses, they confirm our account of events, and Lord <a href="npcs.html#Razak">Razak</a> seems satisfied with our story. He further notices that <a href="npcs.html#Glasstaff">Lord Albrek</a>'s story and the story he has heard from us and the witnesses do not add up, and that there are holes in <a href="npcs.html#Glasstaff">Lord Albrek</a>'s story. When <a href="npcs.html#Glasstaff">Lord Albrek</a> fails to convincingly defend himself, Lord <a href="npcs.html#Razak">Razak</a> confiscates his staff and takes him into custody.</li>
        <li> Lord <a href="npcs.html#Razak">Razak</a> asks us to stay in Phandalin proper for the next day or so while he continues to investigate. He gives us <a href="npcs.html#Glasstaff">Glasstaff</a>'s staff as a gesture of good will. We comply, and pay the Stone Hill Inn a visit.</li>
    </ul>
</ul>

<h3><span id="Stone Hill Inn">Stone Hill Inn</span></h3>
<ul>
    <li> We catch up with the innkeep, who asks what all the fuss is about, and whether it has anything to do with those pesky Redbrands we were inquiring about previously. The party decides not to divulge information about that. Instead, we whet our thirst and our appetites.</li>
    <li> After having some drinks, <a href="npcs.html#Rockseeker">Gundren</a> tells us more about Wave Echo Cave. In particular, he is concerned about his missing brothers, and the circumstances of his ambush by goblins. He suspects that someone was following him. He also does not understand why he was taken alive by the goblins.</li>
    <ul>
        <li> <a href="party.html#Multimodal">Multimodal</a> casts detect magic to determine whether the map has been affected by magic that might allow someone to track it. She finds nothing on the map, but <a href="npcs.html#Glasstaff">Glasstaff</a>'s staff emits a powerful magic aura. She determines that the staff is imbued with magic from the School of Abjuration.</li>
        <li> <a href="party.html#L">"L"</a> has spent enough time to attune to the staff, and discovers that it has properties that benefit a wielder of powerful magic.</li>
    </ul>
    <li> We briefly return to town to sell the valuables we looted in Cragmaw Keep, and to acquire some items that may be helpful to us when we venture on to Wave Echo Cave. Then, we return to the inn to retire for the night. But we are soon disturbed...</li>
</ul>

<h2><span id="Attack on Phandalin">Attack on Phandalin</span></h2>
<ul>
    <li> When the party prepares to settle in for sleep, however, we are disturbed by the sound of a loud horn. <a href="party.html#Zieg">Zieg</a> rushes to the window to determine the source of the alarm, and sees that the golem constructs leading the prison wagons have animated, and living bramble creatures have emerged from the forest.   </li>
    </span><li> <span id="03/03/2018"> <span class="combat">Sounds from battle can be heard in the distance, such as the cries of the wounded. <a href="party.html#L">Bob</a> is surveilling the battle and reports to <a href="party.html#L">"L"</a> that there is trouble outside.</span></li>
    <li> <span class="combat">Several patrons of the inn, including <a href="npcs.html#Rockseeker">Gundren</a> and Lanar, take shelter inside. <a href="party.html#L">"L"</a> sees a twig blight through a window and is able to destroy it with Eldritch Blast. The party leaves the inn one-by-one to determine what has happened, and to aid the town in combat.</span></li>
    <ul>
        <li> <span class="combat"><a href="party.html#Nassirra">Nassirra</a>, <a href="party.html#Rasputin">Rasputin</a>, <a href="party.html#Un-Kell">Ün-Kell</a> and <a href="party.html#Zieg">Zieg</a> are the first to leave the inn, killing several small twig blights and engaging combat with a needle blight. As these members of the party engage the enemy, more cries of anguish can be heard in the distance.</span></li>
        <ul>
            <li> <span class="combat">The needle blight, angered, directs its attack at <a href="party.html#L">Bob</a>, who does not survive.</span></li>
        </ul>
        <li> <span class="combat">Elsa, the bar maid at the Stone Hill Inn, also joins the party. <a href="party.html#Rasputin">Rasputin</a> advises her to return to the shelter of the inn, but she does not comply.</span> </li>
        <li> <span class="combat"><a href="party.html#Rasputin">Rasputin</a> moves closer to the source of the cries, and witnesses a horrible display. <a href="npcs.html#Glasstaff">Glasstaff</a> and his golems are fending off an army of blights that emerged from the forest, including blighted spiders the size of a goliath. <a href="npcs.html#Glasstaff">Glasstaff</a> is relatively helpless without the use of his staff, and has been immobilized by several blights. Soldiers of the Scarlet Vigil bravely try to fend them off, but many of them fall in battle despite their bravery. The blights are too much for <a href="npcs.html#Glasstaff">Glasstaff</a> to contend with, and he succumbs to their attacks. </span></li>
        <li> <span class="combat">The rest of the party makes its way outside the inn and we regroup to take on the blights. As we fight the blights, we notice that some of them&mdash;the blightans&mdash;are able to regenerate after appearing to be dead, seeming to siphon life from the earth below. <a href="party.html#Multimodal">Multimodal</a> begins igniting their corpses with Druidcraft to prevent them from regenerating.</span></li>
        <li> <span class="combat">Reinforcements from the Scarlet Vigil arrive, including <a href="npcs.html#Sildar">Sildar</a> and <a href="npcs.html#Razak">Razak</a>. Elsa, to our surprise, magically summons a blade and begins fighting alongside us, though she does so with caution. She uses frost magic to wound the blights. <a href="party.html#Nassirra">Nassirra</a> climbs onto the backsmith's roof and attacks the blights from afar with her bow. One blight breaks into the building and tries to attack the blacskmith, but he safely escapes. <a href="npcs.html#Razak">Razak</a> comes to our aid and empowers those around him while he attacks, creating a mysterious sensation of cold as he strikes.</span></li>
        <li> <span class="special"><a href="party.html#Zieg">Zieg</a>, using the divine energy of Pelor, casts Channel Divinity to combat several foes at once. As he does, he receives Pelor's blessing and becomes enveloped in radiant light. He is now <a href="party.html#Zieg">Zieg</a>, the Lantern of Hope.</span></li>
    </ul>
    <li> Eventually we manage to kill all of the blights, and assess the damage. We find dead bodies everywhere, including that of <a href="npcs.html#Glasstaff">Glasstaff</a>. Knowing that he was once quite powerful, we scavenge for useful magical items he may still have had in his possession. We find several gem stones, including a pearl, which <a href="party.html#L">"L"</a> eyes with great interest.</li>
    <li> We notice that one of the prison carts remains undisturbed by the blights. It contains the Redbrands we brought into custody previously. They sit fearfully in their confinement. We ask them whether they know anything about the attack, but they appear genuinely ignorant of the situation. </li>
    <li> Suddenly, we become acutely aware of Daren Edermath's absence during the entire ordeal. A chill comes over the party as we realize that the blights approached from the direction of his orchard. We decide to pay him a wellness visit.</li>
    <ul>
        <li> When we arrive, we see smoke pouring out of his cabin. <a href="party.html#Multimodal">Multimodal</a> quickly puts out the flames using Druidcraft, and the group clears the smoke from the cabin. </li>
        <li> When it clears, we are devastated to find Daren dead. <a href="party.html#Zieg">Zieg</a> inspects his wounds and determines that he died from the spines of the blights we just defeated. He had put up a fight, but was no match for the horde of blights beset upon him. </li>
        <li> As we search the room more, we find the corpse of Myrna, who had become his lover. <a href="party.html#Zieg">Zieg</a> closes her eyes and covers her with a blanket to give her some dignity in death. </li>
        <li> Knowing that Daren was once a member of the Scarlet Vigil, and had a history of skilled fighting, we further searched his dwelling and found a chest containing a magical cloak (<i><a href="party.html#Nassirra">Cloak of the Scarlet Vigil</a></i>), clasped with a jewel. Sensing that the cloak must be important, we decided to put it to good use. <a href="party.html#L">"L"</a> holds on to the cloak until we can learn more about its magical properties.</li>
        </span><li> <span id="05/06/2018"> <a href="party.html#Zieg">Zieg</a> and <a href="party.html#Multimodal">Multimodal</a> decide to give Daren and Myrna a proper burial. With the assistance of <a href="party.html#Rasputin">Rasputin</a> and <a href="party.html#Nassirra">Nassirra</a>, we bury them on the orchard near a fence. <a href="party.html#Rasputin">Rasputin</a> and <a href="party.html#Zieg">Zieg</a> say a prayer, and <a href="party.html#Multimodal">Multimodal</a> wishes them peace.</li>
        <li> <a href="party.html#Un-Kell">Ün-Kell</a> voices concern for Myrna's children, and a desire to let them know what transpired. We don't do anything to follow-up on this. </li>
    </ul>
</ul>

<h2><span id="After the Blight Attack">After the Blight Attack</span></h2>
<ul>
    <li> The party returns to the Stone Hill Inn in the early hours of the morning, exhausted. Toblin, the innkeeper, is nowhere to be found, and <a href="npcs.html#Rockseeker">Gundren</a> has already retired for the evening. We follow suit. Before going to sleep, <a href="party.html#L">"L"</a> summons a new familiar (<a href="party.html#L">Bob</a>), who makes chicken sounds. He is also able to uncover the magical properties of the cape found at Daren's home, which allows the wearer to fall slowly and suffer no harm from it.</li>
    <li> When we wake, we find <a href="npcs.html#Rockseeker">Gundren</a> at the bar, drinking ale for breakfast. He expresses his weariness at the difficult week he has experienced, but is happy to see us.</li>
    <ul>
        <li> We ask Toblin for breakfast, and he orders Elsa to get it for us. We recall her magical heroism from the night before, but decide not to bring it up, especially around the other patrons of the inn.</li>
    </ul>
    <li> From the bar, we can hear raised voices outside. <a href="party.html#Zieg">Zieg</a> investigates and observes that a crowd has formed in the town square. <a href="party.html#L">Bob</a>, who has been keeping watch, reports to <a href="party.html#L">"L"</a> that there appear to be two groups of townsfolk arguing with one another. All but <a href="party.html#Rasputin">Rasputin</a> follow <a href="party.html#Zieg">Zieg</a> into the square to see what the hubbub is all about.</li>
    <ul>
        <li> We are surprised to learn that the groups are arguing about our band of adventurers. One group believes we are troublemakers who have intervened without their permission. The word "outsiders" comes up several times, which suggests that they are offended by the diversity of our party. <a href="party.html#Zieg">Zieg</a> tries to persuade them that we are friends, not foes. </li>
        <li> The other group stands up for us, including Linene, but they too are unable to persuade the group who instigated the argument. They are unable to see reason through the lens of hatred.</li>
        <li> Lord <a href="npcs.html#Razak">Razak</a> appears and takes command of the situation. He stands up for us, and further uses his authority to dismiss the crowd.</li>
        <ul>
            <li> We note that the innkeeper's wife, Trilena, was among the group of racists who instigated matters. She retreats to the inn while glaring at us.</li>
        </ul>
    </ul>
    <li> After the crowd dissapates, <a href="npcs.html#Razak">Razak</a> approaches us with more pressing matters. </li>
    <ul>
        <li> First, he pulls a cloth from his pouch containing some items that his men found after the battle. When he opens the cloth, we see that they are prisms carved from strange-looking wood, covered in runes.</li>
        <ul>
            <li> <a href="party.html#Multimodal">Multimodal</a> uses her Firbolg magic to investigate. She discovers that they emit a weak magical aura from the <a href="lore.html#Necromancy">necromancy</a> school. She shudders in horror, as they are most unnatural objects.</li>
            <li> <a href="npcs.html#Razak">Razak</a> explains that the items were found among the remains of the blights who attacked the town the night prior. We are unable to identify the runes or tell him more about the purpose of the objects. <a href="npcs.html#Razak">Razak</a> plans to take them to Elspire to see whether any experts there could tell him more. <a href="party.html#Multimodal">Multimodal</a> cautions him to keep them secret, in case anyone in Elspire has ties to whoever or whatever orchestrated the attack.</li>
        </ul>
        <li> Second, <a href="npcs.html#Razak">Razak</a> reports that he and his men investigated Tresendar Manor, and confirmed our account of the events that transpired there. He expresses concern that many of the townsfolk were either complicit or directly involved in <a href="npcs.html#Glasstaff">Lord Albrek</a>'s plans, and that his death has left a power vacuum.</li>
        <ul>
            <li> He tells us that there will be an investigation underway, and that we will need to travel to Elspire to testify about what took place. He asks how he can reach us to coordinate that when the time comes. We aren't exactly sure where we'll be, and we need to see to other matters in the meantime. He decides to send a runner to pass his word on to us, and gives his sword (<i><a href="party.html#Un-Kell">Lawblade</i></a>) to <a href="party.html#Un-Kell">Ün-Kell</a>, knowing that the runner would recognize it as a gift from Lord <a href="npcs.html#Razak">Razak</a>.</li>
        </ul>
        <li> The last point he wishes to discuss in private. We return to the inn, and he asks Toblin to clear the area so that we can speak plainly.</li>
        <ul>
            <li> He tells us that the kingdom is at war, but the war has been kept secret from its people. There have been incursions from the south originating from the Fetid Tangle. Orcs and hobgoblins led by human sorcerers have been attacking the lands. The town of Triboar has been assaulted more than once. We ask whether <a href="npcs.html#Glasstaff">Lord Albrek</a> could have been one such sorcerer, but he does not know.</li>
            <li> He asks us to join the fight against the incursions. If we choose to do so, he tells us that we should meet with Captain Vilandris at Triboar, a high ranking member of the Scarlet Vigil. </li>
        </ul>
        <li> <a href="npcs.html#Razak">Razak</a> then bids us well, and departs for the battlefront. We wish him well and hope to see him again.</li>
    </ul>
    <li>  After <a href="npcs.html#Razak">Razak</a> leaves, Elsa brings us our breakfast. </li>
    <ul>
        <li>  We make some jabs at her, hinting at her involvement in the events the night before. <a href="party.html#Rasputin">Rasputin</a> asks her for pepper, with a heavy pause before his request in order to throw her off balance. <a href="party.html#Multimodal">Multimodal</a> asks her for ice in her beverage, and Elsa uses her magic to do so. When we ask her what last night was about, she said she was just doing what she could to help the town.</li>
    <li> <a href="npcs.html#Rockseeker">Gundren</a> expresses concern for his brothers, and we discuss our next moves. We decide to head to the place where <a href="npcs.html#Rockseeker">Gundren</a> and his brothers had last made camp after we have finished eating breakfast.</li>
    </ul>
</ul>

<h2><span id="Wave Echo Cave">Wave Echo Cave</span></h2>
<h3><span id="Level 1">Level 1</span></h3>
<ul>
    <li> We follow <a href="npcs.html#Rockseeker">Gundren</a> in our trek to Wave Echo Cave, which takes about a day. We follow the mountains and hug the coast to get there. <a href="npcs.html#Rockseeker">Gundren</a> has clearly traveled this road several times, and warns us about pitfalls along the way. </li>
    <li>Early on in our journey, he draws our attention to a point on the horizon where two mountain ranges meet, and explains that the cave is near that area. We eat rations and forage for food as needed during the journey.</li>
    <li> When we do reach the cave, we see a group of footprints in the area that seem suspicious to us. <a href="npcs.html#Rockseeker">Gundren</a> has no explanation for the footprints, believing that only he and his brothers had been this way. </li>
    <li><a href="npcs.html#Rockseeker">Gundren</a> anxiously rushes into the cave, and we follow after him. </li>
    <ul>
        <li>In the entry chamber, we find three bedrolls and other evidence of a camp. Near the far wall there is an area of the ground that has caved in, opening into a tunnel below. Not far from the cave in, we find the body of <a href="npcs.html#Rockseeker">Tharden</a>, <a href="npcs.html#Rockseeker">Gundren</a>'s brother, wearing very flashy boots. <a href="npcs.html#Rockseeker">Gundren</a> mourns his brother.</li>
        <li><a href="party.html#Rasputin">Rasputin</a> investigates the cave in further and discovers tha the tunnel beneath it extends both east and west. He jumps down into the tunnel, and the rest of the party follows. As we proceed along the curves of the eastern part of the tunnel, we find a large spiral-shaped chamber. <a href="party.html#Nassirra">Nassirra</a> senses the sound of waves crashing coming from below, and the sound of leathery wings flapping.</li>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="party.html#L">Bob</a> investigates the room and reveals that the chamber has five exits, and spans at least two levels of the cave. The clockwise direction of the spiral goes upward from where we stand, and the counter-clockwise direction descends deeper into the cave. </li>
            <li><a href="party.html#Rasputin">Rasputin</a> checks the stone door at the southernmost part of the room. He struggles to pull the door open before realizing that it needs to be pushed to open. Inside, he finds a long bare storm room.</li>
            <li> We decide to head back to the part of the tunnel immediately below the cave in and instead proceed west. We come to a fork in the tunnel, and take the southernmost path, which in turn splits into three different paths. A path that breaks off toward the east appeares to descend into a lower level of the cave, while the other two branches on the west side appear to ascend.</li>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="party.html#Nassirra">Nassirra</a> investigates the upper branch on the west side, and sees a strange, unidentifiable milky mass. <a href="party.html#Multimodal">Multimodal</a> investigates, discovering that the milky mass seems to have a chitinous outer layer covering a living creature.</li>
                <li> We know that something killed <a href="npcs.html#Rockseeker">Tharden</a> and may have killed <a href="npcs.html#Rockseeker">Gundren</a>'s other brother, <a href="npcs.html#Rockseeker">Nundro</a>. We decide not to take any chances with these creatures, who may have been their undoing. <span class="combat"><a href="party.html#Zieg">Zieg</a> launches a spell at one of them and initiates combat. Two foes emerge from the milky goop and reveal themselves to be large insectoid creatures. They attack with a corrosive liquid, and can climb on the ceiling. <a href="party.html#Nassirra">Nassirra</a>, <a href="party.html#Zieg">Zieg</a>, L, <a href="party.html#Multimodal">Multimodal</a>, and <a href="party.html#Un-Kell">Ün-Kell</a> quickly dispatch them.</span></li>
                <li>Upon further inspection, we learn that the creatures were ankhegs, pests of mining operations. We observe that some of the tunnels in the cave have scratches all along the walls, and appear to be made not by man, but by these creatures.</li>
            </ul>
        </ul>
    </ul>
</ul>         

<h3><span id="Level 2">Level 2</span></h3>
<ul>
    <li> We follow the eastward, descending tunnel to see whether more of these creatures exist, and to purge the caverns of them if so. 
    <li> In the level below, we encounter another tunnel that spans from west to east. On the west end of the tunnel, <a href="party.html#Rasputin">Rasputin</a> discovers a waterfall. The party proceeds to the east end of the tunnel, where we encounter four more ankhegs. <span class="combat">We decide to exterminate them with an organized attack.</span></li>
    <ul>
        <li> <span class="combat"><a href="party.html#Zieg">Zieg</a> casts a spell to make the creatures vulnerable to all of our attacks. <a href="party.html#Nassirra">Nassirra</a> unleashes a barrage of arrows and thorns at the creatures, and <a href="party.html#Rasputin">Rasputin</a> and <a href="party.html#Un-Kell">Ün-Kell</a> batter them with devastating melee attacks. <a href="party.html#Multimodal">Multimodal</a>, <a href="party.html#Zieg">Zieg</a>, and <a href="party.html#L">"L"</a> summon powerful magic to combat their foes. The party suffers corrosive acid attacks, but survives. Two of the ankhegs attempted to retreat, but were killed by <a href="party.html#Un-Kell">Ün-Kell</a> and <a href="party.html#Nassirra">Nassirra</a> before they could escape. </span></li>
    </ul>
    <li> As we assess the aftermath of the battle, <a href="party.html#Rasputin">Rasputin</a> heads toward the southern end of the tunnel, but he is stopped dead in his tracks by a strange clittering sound he can hear coming from the south. Similar sounds also come from the east.</li>
    </span><li> <span id="06/09/2018"> We decide to regroup and plan our attack. Most of the party pulls back to the area where we descended from the upper level, which allows us to form a bottleneck. <a href="party.html#Zieg">Zieg</a>, opts to scout out the south tunnel, from which <a href="party.html#Rasputin">Rasputin</a> had just heard chittering sounds. </li>
    <ul>
        <li> He casts alight a piece of copper, then tosses it down the passage to illuminate whatever might be there. He sees another ankheg, and the bespoke creature subsequently melts the copper piece with acid, snuffing out the light.  </li>
        <li> <a href="party.html#L">"L"</a> comes to <a href="party.html#Zieg">Zieg</a>'s aid. The two decide to try luring the ankheg out by using an illusion. To that end, <a href="party.html#L">"L"</a> conjures the image of a figure that somewhat resembles <a href="party.html#Zieg">Zieg</a> further down the tunnel. One of the creatures attempts to attack the illusion briefly, but do not engage beyond that.</li>
    </ul>
    <li> <a href="party.html#Rasputin">Rasputin</a> investigates the part of the tunnel that branches east, where he had also heard sounds emanating from. He explores carefully and finds that the tunnel splits in two directions. To the north, he sees a wooden barricade that has been scratched and etched with acid. To the south, he can make out the figure of a very large ankheg standing on a cliff. </li>
    <li> Suddenly, <a href="party.html#Multimodal">Multimodal</a> and <a href="party.html#L">"L"</a> can hear the sound of burrowing insects moving in the tunnel walls around them. <a href="party.html#L">"L"</a> is able to move westward to get away, but several ankhegs emerge from the tunnel walls before the others can do the same. <span class="combat">They release a spray of acid onto the party, dealing heavy damage to us. <a href="party.html#Nassirra">Nassirra</a> is particularly compromised by the attack. <a href="party.html#Multimodal">Multimodal</a> uses healing magic to stabilize her, while <a href="party.html#Rasputin">Rasputin</a>, <a href="party.html#Un-Kell">Ün-Kell</a>, <a href="party.html#Zieg">Zieg</a>, and <a href="party.html#L">"L"</a> slay the creatures.</span></li>
    <li> The party briefly rests in the store rooom (on Level 1, dubbed "Helm's Deep" by <a href="party.html#Rasputin">Rasputin</a>) to recover from exposure to the caustic substance, and to strategize how best to take down what appears to be the queen ankheg. <a href="party.html#L">"L"</a> conjures an auditory illusion that creates a sound similar to what the ankhegs produce to communicate. <a href="party.html#Rasputin">Rasputin</a>, <a href="party.html#Zieg">Zieg</a>, and <a href="party.html#Un-Kell">Ün-Kell</a> plan to follow the branching passage south. <a href="party.html#Nassirra">Nassirra</a>, <a href="party.html#Multimodal">Multimodal</a>, and <a href="party.html#L">"L"</a> will attack from the passage that branches east.</li>
    <ul>
        <li> <span class="combat">We then begin our attack. <a href="party.html#L">"L"</a> injures the queen slightly with an Eldritch Blast, then <a href="party.html#Zieg">Zieg</a> weakens the creature using Fearie Fire. <a href="party.html#Rasputin">Rasputin</a> charges in and tosses a flask of Alchemists's Fire at the queen, but the glass does not break.</span></li>
        <li> <span class="combat">As we charge in, we realize that the queen was not alone in the chamber. Three ankhegs emerge and attack, one spraying <a href="party.html#L">"L"</a> with acid, and another grappling <a href="party.html#Rasputin">Rasputin</a> with its bite. <a href="party.html#Zieg">Zieg</a> assists <a href="party.html#Rasputin">Rasputin</a> in killing the latter ankheg, liberating <a href="party.html#Rasputin">Rasputin</a> from its grasp.</span></li>
        <li> <span class="combat">The queen becomes defensive, crouching in the back of its perch. It siezes an opportunity to spray <a href="party.html#Nassirra">Nassirra</a> with acid, to little effect, before returning to its defensive stance. <a href="party.html#Nassirra">Nassirra</a> then strikes the queen with a mighty attack from her longbow. In pain, the creature stumbles, breaking the vial of Alchemist's Fire that <a href="party.html#Rasputin">Rasputin</a> had thrown toward it earlier, causing the queen to become wreathed in flame. <a href="party.html#Zieg">Zieg</a> deals a death blow to the creature by emitting beams of raidant light from his hands.</span></li>
        <li> <span class="combat">Meanwhile, <a href="party.html#Rasputin">Rasputin</a>, <a href="party.html#Un-Kell">Ün-Kell</a>, and <a href="party.html#L">"L"</a> dispatch of the remaining ankhegs.</span></li>
        <li> We eplore the chamber behind the remains of the queen and discover egg sacks. <a href="party.html#Multimodal">Multimodal</a> sets to burning them, to prevent more of the abberations from developing, but <a href="party.html#Rasputin">Rasputin</a> steals one for himself in the hopes that he can find an interested buyer. He wraps it in the flesh of the queen. This is fine.</li>
        <li> We also find a magical Zivil Stone, which can maintain satiation and sustenance for its owner. <a href="party.html#Rasputin">Rasputin</a> thinks it would be a fashionable accessory, and decides to hold on to it for now.</li>
    </ul>
    <li> After exploring the rest of the southern tunnels, we decide to uncover what is behind the wooden barricade that <a href="party.html#Rasputin">Rasputin</a> saw toward the north. With <a href="party.html#Zieg">Zieg</a>'s help, <a href="party.html#Un-Kell">Ün-Kell</a> is able to knock down the barricade. On the other side, we find manmade halls that appear to be part of the lost mine. The party splits up to explore further.</li>
    <ul>
        <li> <a href="party.html#Zieg">Zieg</a> and <a href="party.html#Multimodal">Multimodal</a> head to the southwest corner, where they find a dead end. </li>
        <li> <a href="party.html#Nassirra">Nassirra</a> presses north, and comes across what appears to be a skeleton suspended in midair. <span class="combat">It slowly comes closer to her. </span></li>
        <li> <span class="combat"><a href="party.html#Rasputin">Rasputin</a>, who was further south in the same hall, comes to her aid. He charges at the skeleton and, next thing he knows, he has been engulfed by a corrosive gelatinous substance. The creature was not a skeleton at all, but a gelatinous cube. He manages to mindfully slow his heart rate before he loses consciousness, as the creature continues to digest him.</span></li>
        <li> <span class="combat"><a href="party.html#Nassirra">Nassirra</a> runs, shoots an arrow into the gelatinous cube, and watches as it dissolves inside the creature. She calls out for help from her fellow adventurers.</span></li>
        <li> <span class="combat">The commotion is enough to draw the attention of the rest of the party, who rush north to see what is happening.</span> </li>
        <li> <span class="combat">Once he gains a sense for the situation, <a href="party.html#Zieg">Zieg</a> yells for <a href="party.html#Nassirra">Nassirra</a> to keep a safe distance from the creature.</span></li> 
        <li> <span class="combat"><a href="party.html#L">"L"</a> creates an illusion of <a href="party.html#Zieg">Zieg</a> in the monster's path, as a diversion. The diversion successfully draws the creature's attention, allowing <a href="party.html#Nassirra">Nassirra</a> to escape southward down a hallway.</span></li>
        <blockquote><p>Illusion always adds 10 lbs.</p><footer>&mdash; <a href="party.html#Zieg">Zieg</a></footer></blockquote>
        <li> <span class="combat"><a href="party.html#Rasputin">Rasputin</a> manages to wake up and liberate himself from the creature, fleeing in a southerly direction, past <a href="party.html#Nassirra">Nassirra</a>.</span></li>
        <li> <span class="combat"><a href="party.html#Zieg">Zieg</a> attacks the creature with radiant light emanating from his palm, damaging it. <a href="party.html#Multimodal">Multimodal</a> casts spike growth, causing tangles and vines to cover the ground. <a href="party.html#Nassirra">Nassirra</a> launches another arrow at it, after which the creature begins to lose its form. As it advances on the adventurers, spikes from the vines dig into its flesh. After trying to move ten feet forward, the creature succumbs to its wounds.</span></li>
    </ul>
    </span><li> <span id="07/07/2018"> Weary from battle, the party decides to take refuge in the ankheg queen's nest while we rest for the night. <a href="party.html#Nassirra">Nassirra</a> casts an alarm spell to warn us if any creature approaches from the tunnels to the west. <a href="party.html#L">"L"</a>, <a href="party.html#Un-Kell">Ün-Kell</a>, and <a href="party.html#Zieg">Zieg</a> keep a rotating watch in case any threats approach from the mines.</li>
    <ul>
        <li> <a href="party.html#L">"L"</a> and <a href="party.html#Un-Kell">Ün-Kell</a>'s watches are uneventful. During <a href="party.html#Zieg">Zieg</a>'s watch, however, he hears sounds of motion and perhaps a voice calling out from the north, where the mining tunnels are. He is unable to make out the voice, and nothing else occurs during his watch.</li>
        <li> After everyone has rested, <a href="party.html#Zieg">Zieg</a> informs the party of what he heard during the night.</li>
    </ul>
    <li> We return north to explore the rest of the mines, including a stone door we encountered before the gelatinous cube descended upon <a href="party.html#Nassirra">Nassirra</a>. </li>
    <ul>
        <li> <a href="party.html#Rasputin">Rasputin</a> identifies the door as study Dwarven construction, but it is otherwise unremarkable.</li>
        <li> <a href="party.html#Nassirra">Nassirra</a> and <a href="party.html#Multimodal">Multimodal</a> check for tracks, to see who or what may have caused the noise <a href="party.html#Zieg">Zieg</a> heard during his watch. The floor is completely smooth, perhaps in part due to the caustic monster that had roamed the halls. They are unable to detect any tracks on its surface.</li>
        <li> We open the door and discover a second store room, similar to the one above (Helm's Deep). The room contains old, useless mining tools that are unsalvageable. They have been all but disintegrated due to the passage of time and the acidity in the air. It is pungent, and burns our noses. </li>
        <li> A thick layer of fine dust coats every surface in the room. <a href="party.html#Nassirra">Nassirra</a> and <a href="party.html#Multimodal">Multimodal</a> can detect that something has indeed passed through the room, but the dust is not packed enough to reveal footprints and identify the source.</li>
        <li> Across the room there is another stone door. <a href="party.html#Rasputin">Rasputin</a> and <a href="party.html#Un-Kell">Ün-Kell</a> initially struggle to open the door before noticing its handles, and then easily opening the door towards them.</li>
    </ul>
    <li> On the other side of the door we again encounter the spiral chamber, from one level below where we first discovered it. On the western side of the spiral we see a door, and to the southwest is the other ledge that overlooks the waterfall <a href="party.html#Rasputin">Rasputin</a> discovered earlier. We can still hear the beating of leathery wings from above, but the sound is more quiet. An acrid, pungent smell wafts up from the chamber below, very strongly. </li>
    <ul>
        <li> <a href="party.html#Zieg">Zieg</a> casts a copper piece alight and tosses it down into the chamber. Below, we can make out the form of a statue of some kind, and we see that the cavern floor is covered with some kind of fungus. A plant-like creature moves across the floor, perhaps in response to the light. </li>
    </ul>
    <li> We proceed through the western door, deciding to explore more before we descend further into the cave. </li>
    <ul>
        <li> <a href="party.html#Rasputin">Rasputin</a> presses an ear to the door, and hears some kind of commotion. There are certainly creatures waiting for us.</li>
        <li> He and <a href="party.html#Un-Kell">Ün-Kell</a> open the door, revealing some kind of dining hall with several substantial stone tables. The smell of old grease and bad food fills our nostrils. <span class="combat">As <a href="party.html#Un-Kell">Ün-Kell</a> enters the room, a bugbear emerges from an adjoining room. Upon spotting <a href="party.html#Un-Kell">Ün-Kell</a>, it calls for reinforcements. In total, six bugbears engage the party in combat.</span></li>
        <li> <span class="combat">The bugbear approaches <a href="party.html#Un-Kell">Ün-Kell</a> angrily. <a href="party.html#L">"L"</a> attacks it with an Eldritch Blast, burning away layers of flesh from its face. <a href="party.html#Zieg">Zieg</a> casts Sacred Flame and wounds several of the creatures. <a href="party.html#Nassirra">Nassirra</a>, adjacent to <a href="party.html#Un-Kell">Ün-Kell</a>, handily strikes the nearest bugbear with her swords, killing it. <a href="party.html#Multimodal">Multimodal</a> casts spike growth, covering the ground where the remaining five bugbears stand with damaging spikes. The bugbears attempt to move through the spike growth, but thorns from the ground embed in their skin, causing them pain and confusion.</span></li>
        <li> <span class="combat"><a href="party.html#L">"L"</a> and <a href="party.html#Un-Kell">Ün-Kell</a> take care of the next bugbear in line with an Eldritch Blast and radiant energy fueled by <a href="party.html#Un-Kell">Ün-Kell</a>'s zealotry. <a href="party.html#Zieg">Zieg</a> lights two of the beasts with faerie fire, making them easier targets for the party. <a href="party.html#Nassirra">Nassirra</a> jumps onto a nearby table and sends an arrow into one of the bugbears. <a href="party.html#Multimodal">Multimodal</a> sends a frigid ice knife into another. <a href="party.html#Rasputin">Rasputin</a>, unable to enter the field of spike growth without suffering harm himself, jumps from one stone table to the next. He lands a bit clumsily, suffering a nasty bruise, but is then able to send his fists into the nearest bugbears, killing one and harming the next. The second bugbear does not take kindly to the beating, and deals a mighty blow to <a href="party.html#Rasputin">Rasputin</a> in turn.</span></li>
        <li> <span class="combat"><a href="party.html#Un-Kell">Ün-Kell</a>, also unable to navigate the spike growth safely, hurls a javelin with all of his strength into the nearest bugbear, dealing the killing blow. <a href="party.html#Nassirra">Nassirra</a> then attacks the next bugbear in line with another arrow, and <a href="party.html#Multimodal">Multimodal</a> is able to land the killing blow using only a weak magical spell. <a href="party.html#Rasputin">Rasputin</a> jumps to another table to attack the last bugbear. But, he also offers the bugbear an opportunity to lay down its arms and surrender, in exchange for the possibility of surviving.</span></li>
    </ul> 
    <li> We clap the bugbear in irons and interrogate him.</li>
        <ul>
            <li> Upon being asked by <a href="party.html#Un-Kell">Ün-Kell</a> he tells us, incredulously, that his favorite color is red.</li>
            <li> More importantly, he confirms that he is not working alone, and that there are more of his allies in the caverns below. Some of them are bugbears, some are not. He tells us that his boss is a dark elf who summons strange creatures, including spiders. We infer that he may be speaking of the notorious <a href="npcs.html#The Spider">Spider</a> we first learned about from the Cragmaw goblins. He confirms that the elf does sometimes go by this name.</li>
            <ul>
                <li> He further tells us that <a href="npcs.html#The Spider">Spider</a> is capable of casting spells, bending the earth around him to his will, summoning unnatural creatures such as those that attacked Phandalin, and can use fiery magic as well.</li>
                <li> We ask him if he has seen a dwarf. He confirms that his group encountered two dwarves, killing one and kidnapping the other. We infer that <a href="npcs.html#Rockseeker">Nundro</a> is alive, and has been held captive by <a href="npcs.html#The Spider">Spider</a>.</li>
                <li> We ask whether there are traps we need to look out for. He says there are none in the mines, but that there are many traps elsewhere in the caverns. He also warns that he and his allies were not able to contend with whatever lurks in the lowest level of the spiral chamber.</li>
            </ul>
            <li> <a href="party.html#Rasputin">Rasputin</a> begins to tie a rope to the bugbear's manacles, to serve as a leash. We decide that he may be valuable as we navigate the cave. The bugbear, however, has other ideas. He refuses to be our "pet", and only wants to live if he can be set free. We can't take the risk of letting him escape, knowing that bugbears are not benevolent creatures. <span class="combat">Instead, we decide to execute the bugbear quickly and humanely. <a href="party.html#Un-Kell">Ün-Kell</a> grabs for his law blade, but he is unable to kill an unarmed bugbear after growing up around goblin folk. <a href="party.html#L">"L"</a>, <a href="party.html#Nassirra">Nassirra</a>, and <a href="party.html#Rasputin">Rasputin</a> instead deal the killing blows.</span></li>
            <li> We continue to explore the area. Two stone doors sit ajar, leading to the room the bugbears came from. Inside we find a kitchen with raw, partially rotten meat that the bugbears may have been preparing for a meal. The food in an adjoining pantry is all spoiled. We decide there is nothing more of value here, and move on. </li>
         </ul>
</ul>

<h3><span id="Level 3">Level 3</span></h3>
<ul>
    <li> We return to the spiral chamber and head to the southwest corner, where the waterfall is. We decide to explore the water. <a href="party.html#Zieg">Zieg</a> sets another copper piece alight and tosses it into the water. Nothing happens in response, suggesting that it may be safe. He is comfortable in water, as a Triton, and volunteers to explore. <a href="party.html#Multimodal">Multimodal</a> decides to go as well, and uses her druidic magic to assume the form of a giant crab. <a href="party.html#Un-Kell">Ün-Kell</a> holds on to a rope so that he can pull us up after we explore.
        <ul>
            <li> After diving into the water, <a href="party.html#Zieg">Zieg</a> notices something reflecting light at the bottom. He uncovers a mysterious bracelet partially buried in the sediment. He takes the bracelet for safekeeping.</li>
            <li> A current in the water pulls us toward the eastern wall, where there is some kind of channel. It is large enough for one of us to fit through. <a href="party.html#Zieg">Zieg</a> decides to explore, holding on to the rope just in case. The channel is rocky and dangerous, but he is able to follow it and discover another manmade room with a broken water wheel. He then returns to the waterfall.</li>
            <li> <a href="party.html#Multimodal">Multimodal</a> discovers another chute to the south, with very little current. It is much safer to navigate, she discovers. <a href="party.html#Zieg">Zieg</a> follows to see where the chute leads. It leads into a chamber that has natural walls carved by Ankhegs. They can easily wade out of the water and into a tunnel. After exploring the water's edge, <a href="party.html#Multimodal">Multimodal</a> and <a href="party.html#Zieg">Zieg</a> return to the main waterfall chamber where <a href="party.html#Zieg">Zieg</a> reports their findings to the group. We decide that the rest of the party should come down, and we can use one of the three potential exit points to launch a surprise attack on whatever lurks in the adjoining rooms. </li>
            <li> <a href="party.html#Rasputin">Rasputin</a> manages to jump down without incident. <a href="party.html#L">"L"</a> gets caught in the current after jumping down, and <a href="party.html#Multimodal">Multimodal</a> uses one of her giant crab claws to stop him from being swept away in the current. It is painful, but it works. </li>
            <li> <a href="party.html#Rasputin">Rasputin</a> and <a href="party.html#L">"L"</a> climb a ledge to the north which connects to the bottom of the spiral chamber. They can feel intense burning as they breathe near the chamber. <a href="party.html#L">"L"</a> sends <a href="party.html#L">Bob</a> to scout. <a href="party.html#L">Bob</a>'s eyes burn in the thick, green-tinged air. He sees a statue of some kind of Dwarf warrior facing the eastern side of the room, and fungus everywhere.</li>
            <li> <a href="party.html#Nassirra">Nassirra</a> jumps down and struggles in the water. <a href="party.html#Multimodal">Multimodal</a> reaches a claw out and grasps one of her vines, keeping her from getting caught in the current. As <a href="party.html#Nassirra">Nassirra</a> struggles to get to the ledge, she again is swept into the water, and <a href="party.html#Multimodal">Multimodal</a> grabs her with a claw again, this time causing some damage. She is able to climb onto the ledge. <a href="party.html#Un-Kell">Ün-Kell</a> jumps down, making a huge splash in the water. </li>
            <li> As our party members gather outside the spiral room, <a href="party.html#Rasputin">Rasputin</a> enters. He unwittingly disturbs some of the fungus, which launches spores into his face. The spores are painful, and cause temporary blindness.</li>
            <li> Upon seeing what has happened to <a href="party.html#Rasputin">Rasputin</a>, we decide to avoid the spiral chamber for now. Instead, we opt to take the southern channel, where the current was not as strong. <a href="party.html#Zieg">Zieg</a> helps ferry the party across the water while <a href="party.html#Multimodal">Multimodal</a> uses her giant crab form to block off the eastern channel, where the current is strongest. This prevents <a href="party.html#L">"L"</a> and <a href="party.html#Rasputin">Rasputin</a> from being sucked into the current as they struggle to swim across the water.</li>
    </ul>
    <li> Eventually, the party makes it through the southern channel and emerges in the tunnel southeast of the waterfall. <a href="party.html#Multimodal">Multimodal</a> returns to her Firbolg form. The party explores further and discovers an Ankheg tunnel heading south, but a wooden blockade to the north.</li>
    <li> We decide to break down the blockade. <a href="party.html#Un-Kell">Ün-Kell</a> slams into it, allowing us passage through to the room on the other side. There are two ruin structures in the room that appear to be water wheels of some kind, and there is something amiss about the situation.</li>
    <ul>
        <li> Immediately, <a href="party.html#Un-Kell">Ün-Kell</a> and <a href="party.html#Rasputin">Rasputin</a> can hear ominous scratching sounds coming from somewhere in side the room, and the smell of sulfur and soot waft into their noses. As we enter the room, we see that there are some strange creatures, similar to spiders or crabs in form, but with jeweled eyes. They are elemental in form, with glowing crystals for eyes.</li>
        </span><li> <span id="11/11/2018"> <span class="combat"><a href="party.html#Nassirra">Nassirra</a> and <a href="party.html#L">"L"</a> attack the strange crab that is nearest the party, in the southern part of the room. <a href="party.html#Rasputin">Rasputin</a> drinks a potion to recover his strength from the wounds he suffered in previous battles and his struggle down the waterfall. </span></span>
        <li> <span class="combat">The second creature, furthest from the party, launches an attack against the group. <a href="party.html#Rasputin">Rasputin</a> and <a href="party.html#Nassirra">Nassirra</a> fall unconscious as a result. <span class="special"><a href="party.html#Multimodal">Multimodal</a> heals both of them and is bestowed with the title "<a href="party.html#Multimodal">Multimodal</a> the Lifeweaver".</span></span> </li>
        <li> <span class="combat"><a href="party.html#Un-Kell">Ün-Kell</a> strikes the closest foe with his lawblade and kills it, leaving but a pile of earth and the two glowing crystal eyes. <a href="party.html#L">"L"</a> uses his knowledge of the arcane arts to determine that the creatures are glowmites, rock elementals with regenerative powers. He shares this information with the rest of the party. In response, <a href="party.html#Nassirra">Nassirra</a> attempts to smash the glowing eye crystals on the ground, which causes the glow to dim.</span> </li>
        <li> <span class="combat"><a href="party.html#Zieg">Zieg</a> sends a guiding bolt toward the remaining glowmite, but the spell does not harm it. <a href="party.html#L">"L"</a> launches an Eldritch Blast at the creature that is similarly ineffective. In response, it attacks <a href="party.html#Zieg">Zieg</a> and <a href="party.html#Un-Kell">Ün-Kell</a>, causing modest damage to them. <a href="party.html#Multimodal">Multimodal</a> weakens the creature with faerie fire. <a href="party.html#Un-Kell">Ün-Kell</a> and <a href="party.html#L">"L"</a> manage to reduce the creature to rubble. </span></li>
        <li> <a href="party.html#Rasputin">Rasputin</a> takes one of the glowmite eyes from the carcass, despite objections from members of the party.</li>
        <li> Further inspection of the now-safe room reveals that the water wheel was part of some type of forging apparatus, suggesting that the forge <a href="npcs.html#Rockseeker">Gundren</a> and his brothers sought is near.</li>
        <li> The party turns their attention toward the northern part of the room, where two ornate doors stand. They are coered in glowing runes that are almost like Dwarven runes. There are symbols depicting an eye, a hammer, mountains, and fire. <a href="party.html#Rasputin">Rasputin</a> and <a href="party.html#Zieg">Zieg</a> use their Dwarven and religious knowledge, respectively, to determine that the symbols relate to the Dwarven creation myth. The creator of the Dwarves, Morvain, was said to have discovered the earth, heated it with flame, and forged the Dwarves from it with a hammer. <a href="party.html#Rasputin">Rasputin</a> touches the symbols in the sequence that corresponds to the myth: the eye for Morvain, the mountains for earth, fire, and then the hammer. The door then opens.</li>
    </ul>
    <li> On the other side of the door, the party finds a large chamber with an obelisk and a dais with an altar, and an eerie lit brazier of green flame. Two unlit, smaller braziers sit in the far corners of the room. Two green, round, similarly eerie objects reveal themselves to be eye stalks, and speak to the party. They mistake the party for workers, who are forbidden from the chamber, and ask the party to return to work. </li>
    <li> Straight across from the opened, ornate door is a hole in the wall that is actively being dug out by a bugbear. The bugbear spots the party, and warns someone that he calls "boss". The party heeds the eye stalks' request for us to leave by proceeding through the hole in the wall to a new chamber, which once was a library, where we discover an elf of some kind accompanied by blighted spiders and bugbears. Two dwarves, unidentifiable at our range, sit in the far corner of the room near the elf.</li>
    <ul>
        <li> The elf acknowledges that he is the figure we have known only as "<a href="npcs.html#The Spider">The Spider</a>". He further states that we have caused a great deal of trouble for him, but he tries to be friends with us. He offers to reunite us with <a href="npcs.html#Rockseeker">Nundro</a>, <a href="npcs.html#Rockseeker">Gundren</a>'s missing brother. Further investigation reveals that this "<a href="npcs.html#Rockseeker">Nundro</a>" is actually a doppleganer, aligned with <a href="npcs.html#The Spider">The Spider</a>, disguised as <a href="npcs.html#Rockseeker">Nundro</a>. </li>
        <ul>
            <li> The elf pleads with us to hear him out, and for some reason, we do. Kind of. His real name is Na'Zandar, and he is from the <a href="lore.html#The Feywild">Feywild</a> elves who once dwelled in the land now known as Phandalin, which was stolen by humans. He seeks vengeance and wants to use the spellforge to arm his troops. He asks us to join his cause, seeing that none of us are humans, and assumes we will be sympathetic. He had not even made it to the spell forge, the chamber adjacent to this room, before we arrived.</li>
            <li> We make it clear that we can't trust him, he tried to kill us multiple times already, and that we cannot abide his blood for blood mentality. </li>
        </ul>
        <li> <span class="combat"><a href="party.html#Zieg">Zieg</a> decides he has heard enough, and communes with Pelor to ignite his enemies with radiant flame. Na'Zandar responds by heating the metal of <a href="party.html#Zieg">Zieg</a>'s armor, then assuming the form of a spider and climbing to the ceiling.</span></li>
        <ul>
            <li> <span class="combat"><a href="party.html#L">"L"</a> and <a href="party.html#Rasputin">Rasputin</a> turn their attention to the doppleganger near them. <a href="party.html#Nassirra">Nassirra</a> nimbly climbs atop a bookcase and takes aim with her bow. Ultimately, <a href="party.html#L">"L"</a>, <a href="party.html#Nassirra">Nassirra</a>, and <a href="party.html#Rasputin">Rasputin</a> manage to slay it, though <a href="party.html#Rasputin">Rasputin</a> suffers heavy blows in the fight. <a href="party.html#Multimodal">Multimodal</a> heals him.</span></li>
            <li> <span class="combat"><a href="party.html#Multimodal">Multimodal</a> summons a flame-wreathed magical blade and attacks a bugbear in the southern part of the room with it. She and <a href="party.html#L">"L"</a> manage to kill it in several blows, though <a href="party.html#Multimodal">Multimodal</a> does not manage to finish the fight unscathed. </span></li>
            <li> <span class="combat"><a href="party.html#Zieg">Zieg</a> weakens Na'Zandar and his surrounding minions with faerie fire. <a href="party.html#Un-Kell">Ün-Kell</a> and <a href="party.html#Nassirra">Nassirra</a> proceed to slay the bugbear flanking Na'Zandar. <a href="party.html#Nassirra">Nassirra</a> does an impressive backflip onto an adjacent bookshelf. <a href="party.html#Un-Kell">Ün-Kell</a> turns his attention to Na'Zandar, climbing onto a workbench to reach his arachnid form on the ceiling. <a href="party.html#Zieg">Zieg</a>'s scalding hot armor periodically wounds him, but by the grace of Pelor he bears the pain and managed to hurl a magical guiding bolt at Na'Zandar, which knocks him out of his arachnid form and onto the floor.</span></li>
            <li> <span class="combat"><a href="party.html#L">"L"</a> nearly single-handedly destroys the blighted spider in the southern corner of the room, leaving only the weakened form of Na'Zandar and one last blighted spider in the northern corner of the room. </span></li>
            <li> <span class="combat"><a href="party.html#Rasputin">Rasputin</a> strikes Na'Zandar, and he appears to vanish in response. <a href="party.html#Nassirra">Nassirra</a> uses her keen ability to track her targets and determines that he has not disappeared, but has shapeshifted into a tiny spider. She yells this information to the rest of the party so that we know to search for him. <a href="party.html#Multimodal">Multimodal</a> shapeshifts into a spider and climbs on the ceiling, then uses her spider senses to try and locate other spiders that may be on the same web. She only detects the large blight spider that remains, which <a href="party.html#L">"L"</a> proceeds to kill with an Eldritch Blast.</span> </li>
            <li> <span class="combat"><a href="party.html#Zieg">Zieg</a> locates the tiny form of Na'Zandar and smashes it with his spectral mace, once again forcing Na'Zandar back into his elf form. The party gathers around Na'Zandar, intimidating him, and ordering him to surrender. <a href="party.html#Rasputin">Rasputin</a> punches him in the face, and knocks him out. We take the opportunity to liberate him from the magical objects that aid him, including his spell-casting focus (a wooden staff) and a magical cloak. <a href="party.html#Multimodal">Multimodal</a>, still in spider form, wraps his body tightly in webs to restrain him. </span></li>
            <ul>
                    <li> <a href="party.html#Multimodal">Multimodal</a> decides she can make use of his magical staff (<i><a href="party.html#Multimodal">The Elder Branch</a></i>) as her druidic focus. <a href="party.html#Un-Kell">Ün-Kell</a> decides to don the cloak (<i><a href="party.html#Un-Kell">Cloak of Arachnids</a></i>), which can harm melee attackers.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>  We find that <a href="npcs.html#Rockseeker">Nundro</a> is still alive, though he does not look well. <a href="party.html#Zieg">Zieg</a> administers a healing potion to him, which revives him. We tell him who we are, and that his brother <a href="npcs.html#Rockseeker">Gundren</a> is alive and well. He says he does not know why he was kept alive.</li>
            <li> Now that the room is safe, we take the opportunity to explore it. <a href="party.html#L">"L"</a> finds some magical tomes and studies them, though many of them are theoretical in nature, not tomes of spells and other practical magics. </li>
            <li>The party discovers a <a href="lore.html#Cryptic Map">cryptic map</a> of the continent, surrounded by six objects. Question marks surrounding the objects and arrows appear to indicate where the map maker believed those objects might be, though there is clearly high uncertainty over the objects' locations. </li>
            <li>A shaft that may contain something like a dumbwaiter is located in the northwest corner of the room.</li>
        </ul>
    </ul>
    <li> We decide to barricade ourselves in the library using the bookshelves in order to recuperate from battle and tend to our various wounds. <a href="party.html#Nassirra">Nassirra</a> protects the party with an alarm spell to warn us of any danger that might come upon us in our sleep. 
        <ul>
            </span><li> <span id="12/02/2018"> As we beging to settle down, we discuss how we want to deal with the villanous Na'Zandar. <a href="party.html#Zieg">Zieg</a> and <a href="party.html#Multimodal">Multimodal</a> make it clear that they want <a href="npcs.html#The Spider">the Spider</a> to pay for his crimes with his life. <a href="party.html#L">"L"</a> suspects that he may yet be of value to the party, and wishes to keep him alive. <a href="party.html#Multimodal">Multimodal</a> cautions that if he wakes, he will be able to assume the form of a beast again and bypass his restraints, which would potentially allow him to escape. <a href="party.html#L">"L"</a> plans to make Na'Zandar comply by magical means in order to gain information. </li>
            <li> The party designates watches to make sure nothing nefarious occurs during the rest period. <a href="party.html#Un-Kell">Ün-Kell</a> and <a href="party.html#L">"L"</a> take the first watch, <a href="party.html#Rasputin">Rasputin</a> and <a href="party.html#Zieg">Zieg</a> the second, and <a href="party.html#Nassirra">Nassirra</a> and <a href="party.html#Multimodal">Multimodal</a> the final watch.</li>
            <ul>
                <li> The first watch is strangely eventful. </li>
                <ul>
                    <li> First, the glowmite crystal that <a href="party.html#Rasputin">Rasputin</a> kept in his pocket began to regenerate a glowmite, <span class="combat">ripping out from <a href="party.html#Rasputin">Rasputin</a>'s pocket. <a href="party.html#Rasputin">Rasputin</a> kills the glowmite and returns the crystal to his pouch. Some time later, the glowmite begins to regenerate again, bursting from the pouch. This time, <a href="party.html#Rasputin">Rasputin</a> beats the crystal with a hammer until the soft glow that had emanated from it is extinguished. </span></li>
                    <li> Second, <a href="party.html#L">"L"</a> and <a href="party.html#Un-Kell">Ün-Kell</a> notice Na'Zandar wake. <a href="party.html#L">"L"</a> tries to use dark magic to force Na'Zandar to give us information, but his attempts fail. Instead, he and <a href="party.html#Un-Kell">Ün-Kell</a> intimidate <a href="npcs.html#The Spider">the Spider</a> into revealing information, but all he is able to tell us is that the spell forge is powered by fey magic. <span class="combat"><a href="party.html#L">"L"</a> decides that Na'Zandar is no longer of use to us. <a href="party.html#Un-Kell">Ün-Kell</a> slams his shield against him and knocks him unconscious again.</span></li>
                </ul>
                <li> The second watch was also very eventful.</li>
                <ul>
                    <li> At the beginning of the second watch, <a href="party.html#L">"L"</a> and <a href="party.html#Un-Kell">Ün-Kell</a> convey their thoughts to <a href="party.html#Zieg">Zieg</a> and <a href="party.html#Rasputin">Rasputin</a>. </li>
                    <li> <span class="combat"><a href="party.html#Rasputin">Rasputin</a> agrees that Na'Zandar must die, and decides to carry out the act himself. After <a href="party.html#Zieg">Zieg</a> performs last rites, <a href="party.html#Rasputin">Rasputin</a> takes a hand axe and slits Na'Zandar's throat, then watches him bleed to death.</span></li>
                    <li> <span class="special">Suddenly, <a href="party.html#Rasputin">Rasputin</a> begins to feel blood running down his own chest, but he has no bleeding wound. His tattoo begins to change; he is transformed as he enters the Maw of the Demon Lord. <a href="party.html#Zieg">Zieg</a>'s vision turns to darkness mysteriously. He is filled with a sense of dread. He examines <a href="party.html#Rasputin">Rasputin</a>'s tattoo and recognizes it to be a symbol of great evil. He fears for his companion, and encourages <a href="party.html#Rasputin">Rasputin</a> to be cautious.</span></li>
                </ul>
                <li> At the beginning of the third watch, <a href="party.html#Zieg">Zieg</a> conveys his concern about <a href="party.html#Rasputin">Rasputin</a> to <a href="party.html#Multimodal">Multimodal</a>, who too seems concerned. Rastpuin assures them both that he is simply becoming closer to death, but that he is open to help from his companions to maintain balance between life and death.</li>
                <ul>
                    <li> <span class="special"><a href="party.html#Nassirra">Nassirra</a> reaches a new level of control over her vines after rehashing the events of the previous combat. She is able to manipulate them such that she can reach a target within 20 feet at will. </span></li>
                </ul>
            </ul>
            <li> After resting the party feels rejuvenated, though <a href="npcs.html#Rockseeker">Nundro</a> is still a bit worse for wear. He sees what has befallen <a href="npcs.html#The Spider">the Spider</a> and expresses relief. </li>
    </ul>
</ul>
<h3><span id="After Na'Zandar">After Na'Zandar</a></h3>
<ul>
    <li> <a href="party.html#Nassirra">Nassirra</a> resumes exploring by investigating the dumbwaiter more closely. She enters the dumbwaiter and, with <a href="party.html#Un-Kell">Ün-Kell</a>'s assistance, ascends to the upper levels of the mine. She recognized the second level to be the same halls in which the group encountered a deadly gelatinous cube. She continues on to the first level, where she finds more stoneworked halls that the party had not yet explored.</li>
    <ul>
        <li> She hears a strange sound, like raw meat slapping, and a groan. She exits the dumbwaiter to investigate, until her instincts tell her that the danger is too great for her to take on alone. She returns to the dumbwaiter and calls out to <a href="party.html#Un-Kell">Ün-Kell</a> to bring her back down. <span class="combat">Her yell attracts the attention of what was once a Dwarf miner, but now is a rotting undead monstrosity. <a href="party.html#Un-Kell">Ün-Kell</a> pulls the chains to lower the dumbwaiter, but not before the zombie jumps on top of it.</span> <a href="party.html#Nassirra">Nassirra</a> exits the dumbwaiter on the third level and tells the party what she found.</li>
        <li> <a href="party.html#Zieg">Zieg</a> and <a href="party.html#Rasputin">Rasputin</a> decide to put down the creature. <a href="party.html#Zieg">Zieg</a> wards of evil by blessing himself and <a href="party.html#Rasputin">Rasputin</a>. <span class="combat">As the dumbwaiter ascends, the zombie's toes get clipped off and thick, syrupy brown liquid pours out of the wounds. When it reaches the first level of the cave, the dumbwaiter crushes the zombie between the cavern ceiling and the dumbwaiter. <a href="party.html#Rasputin">Rasputin</a> strikes the still-wriggling zombie in the eye, killing it once and for all.</span></li>
        <li> <a href="party.html#Zieg">Zieg</a> and <a href="party.html#Rasputin">Rasputin</a> reveal a long stoneworked hallway, and turn left at the end to continue down another hall with three doors. <a href="party.html#Rasputin">Rasputin</a> attempts to open the first door, but it does not budge. <a href="party.html#Zieg">Zieg</a> spots skeletal remains and a blood stain on the floor near another door that is ajar. <span class="combat">He catches a glimpse inside the door and discovers that there are more zombies inside to contend with. <a href="party.html#Rasputin">Rasputin</a> joins him, rushing into the room and striking one of the zombies. In doing so, he discovers that the room is full of the undead.</span> </li>
        <li> Around this time, the rest of the party grows concerned and decides to go upstairs and help. <a href="party.html#L">"L"</a>, <a href="party.html#Nassirra">Nassirra</a>, and <a href="party.html#Multimodal">Multimodal</a> pile into the dumbwaiter after <a href="party.html#Un-Kell">Ün-Kell</a> summons it back down to the third level of the cave. It takes some time, but he manages to hoist the group back up.</li>
        <li> <span class="combat">While the rest of the party ascends in the dumbwaiter, <a href="party.html#Rasputin">Rasputin</a> manages to kill one of the zombies. <a href="party.html#Zieg">Zieg</a> then ignites the entire room with a mighty fireball, decimating all but two of the monsters, which <a href="party.html#Rasputin">Rasputin</a> is then easily able to kill with his fists.</span></li>
        <li> The gang regroups and then continues to explore the halls. <a href="party.html#Un-Kell">Ün-Kell</a> goes back to the first door that <a href="party.html#Rasputin">Rasputin</a> could not open. Despite his strength, he too is unable to open the door, though the force of his strength cracks the door. <a href="party.html#Nassirra">Nassirra</a> explores the next room along the same side of the hall and discovers a room that is empty save for a few old, deteriorating beds. There is a door on the right side of the room that leads to the room <a href="party.html#Rasputin">Rasputin</a> and <a href="party.html#Un-Kell">Ün-Kell</a> attempted to enter earlier. <a href="party.html#Nassirra">Nassirra</a> explores the room and smells something strange that is both acrid and sweet. </li>
        <ul>
            <li> She discovers a humanoid creature hiding behind a bed that looks somehow fungal in nature. <a href="party.html#Un-Kell">Ün-Kell</a> joins her, followed by <a href="party.html#Multimodal">Multimodal</a>. It does not appear to be hostile.</li>
            <li> <a href="party.html#Multimodal">Multimodal</a> tries to identify the creature with no success. She asks whether it is friend or foe, but cannot understand the creature's response.

            <li> <a href="party.html#Un-Kell">Ün-Kell</a> tries to offer it some jerky from his rations, but it is not enticed. </li>
            <li> <a href="party.html#Multimodal">Multimodal</a> tries to comfort it, and offers a pineapple to the creature. It warily approaches the pineapple and begins eating the leaves. <a href="party.html#Multimodal">Multimodal</a> decides to name it Spike II.</li>
            <li> The creature releases a cloud of rapport spores that land on <a href="party.html#L">"L"</a>, <a href="party.html#Nassirra">Nassirra</a>, <a href="party.html#Multimodal">Multimodal</a>, and <a href="party.html#Un-Kell">Ün-Kell</a>. The spores allow them to communicate with the sporeling and feel its emotions. It reveals that it is lost and needs help finding its family. <a href="party.html#Un-Kell">Ün-Kell</a>, <a href="party.html#Nassirra">Nassirra</a>, and <a href="party.html#Multimodal">Multimodal</a> decide to help it. <a href="party.html#L">"L"</a> decides to rejoin <a href="party.html#Rasputin">Rasputin</a> and <a href="party.html#Zieg">Zieg</a> to explore elsewhere. <a href="party.html#L">"L"</a> sends <a href="party.html#L">Bob</a> with the escort team to keep watch, and <a href="npcs.html#Rockseeker">Nundro</a> joins the escort efforts as well. The party decides to reconvene in Helm's Deep after their respective missions are complete.</li>
            <li> The sporeling creature leads us back to the large spiral chamber, and directs us to a stoneworked hall on the other side of the spiral. They easily cross, and upon entering the hallway they discover a reception area with another sporeling that is mouthing an old tome. It senses the spores on the adventurers and greets us warmly. Then, when Spike II enters the room, the two sporelings rejoice. Spike II thanks us and welcomes us to visit any time. </li>
            <li> We decide to explore the rest of the sporeling's commune. First we find a large room with bookshelves and a group of sporelings enjoying the books, chewing on them. There are a series of small offices occupied by sporelings, all of whom cheerily greet us as we explore. Finally, we find a large office that is unoccupied. In the corner there is a large desk. <a href="party.html#Nassirra">Nassirra</a> examines the desk and finds a locked drawer, which she picks deftly with her thieves tools.</li>
            <ul>
                <li> Inside the desk she finds a deteroriating old document, which she realizes is the deed for Wave Echo Cave. It names an entity with whom the party is not familiar as proprieter of the mine. She also finds a small box containing gold pieces, which she distributes among the three of them.</li>

        <li> <a href="party.html#Nassirra">Nassirra</a> asks to speak with Qelline. Carp yells out for her, and eventually her neglectful ass shows up. She tells us that the town has largely recovered from the recent attack, and now everyone is gearing up for a festival called Reverence Day, which will happen in a week's time. The festival honors wind spirits. </li>
    </ul>
    <li> We move further into town. <a href="party.html#Un-Kell">Ün-Kell</a> decides to do a "weekend at Bernie's" with Na'Zandar's corpse, frightening innocent townsfolk.

                <li> <a href="party.html#Zieg">Zieg</a> asks them if they know anything about Old Owl Well, but they don't have any information and are very inebriated. Toblin overhears and shares what he can.</li>

                    <li> He tells us that Old Owl Well is located off the road between Phandalin and Triboar, closer to Triboar. It has fresh water in the well, and there is an abandoned tower nearby. He warns that orcs may attack us on the way, and urges us to be careful.</li>

    <li> With the undead threat extinguished, we examine the rest of the grounds. </li>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="party.html#Zieg">Zieg</a> explores a nearby tent. It contains a fine wooden desk and a series of strange vials. A dead human male lies on the floor, clearly a victim of the zombies' hunger. He bears tattoos and wears a red robe with black markings. Clasped in his hands is a <a href="lore.html#Journal">journal</a>. </li>
        <ul>
            <li> <a href="party.html#Zieg">Zieg</a> takes the <a href="lore.html#Journal">journal</a> and peruses it. He discovers that the man's name is Hamun Kost, and he was a necromancer. He had used dark wood, like the runed splinters we found after Phandalin was attacked, to imbue his creations with a necrotic aura. The <a href="lore.html#Journal">journal</a> mentions the town of Lucav, which is on the northeast side of the continent. It also mentions a fishing village to the south that <a href="party.html#Zieg">Zieg</a> likely knows, but does not give a name. Finally, it mentions rumors of a ruined town called Thundertree, which Hamun learned of in Westport (and so it might be nearby). </li>
            <li> <a href="party.html#Zieg">Zieg</a> searches the desk. He finds a potion of greater healing along with some strange vials. We decide to burn the tent in a controlled manner so that nobody else can commit the atrocities that Hamun carried out here. </li>
            <li> <a href="party.html#Zieg">Zieg</a> investigates the well, which appears to be normal and has clear water. We examine the nearby ruined tower and find little left of it at all. The floor has rotted away and its walls have fallen down. </li>
        </ul>
        <li> <a href="party.html#Multimodal">Multimodal</a> and <a href="party.html#Zieg">Zieg</a> use their spirtual connections to intuit whether these zombies and those that we found at Wave Echo Cave are similar. We determine that the creatures here were zombies, deceased humans who were reanimated, and those in Wave Echo Cave were ghouls, creatures sent from hell that had never lived previously. We consider going to the temples in Elspire to learn more.</li>

<h2><span id="Arrival in Triboar">Arrival in Triboar</span></h2>
<ul>
    <li> We follow the Triboar Trail east until we find the town, comprised of three hills surrounded by a fence.</li>
    <li> We are approached by a figure on horseback. The man introduces himself as Sir Grimleaf. He asks what our business is in Triboar. <a href="party.html#Zieg">Zieg</a> tells him that we were sent by <a href="npcs.html#Razak">Razak</a>. Sir Grimleaf recognizes the name and is very impressed. He tells us that Triboar is a dangerous place, frequently under orc attack, and that we can inquire with Captain Vilandris at Whitewood Palace if we want to help.</li>
    <li> We enter the town and find a tavern called The Cornered Cat. There are roads that branch out from the town center and reach each of the three hills. The palace is located on the southern hill. </li>
    <li> Before going to the palace, we decide to visit The Cornered Cat for some lunch and gossip about the town. Immediately, we notice that the floor is sticky and the tavern smells. </li>
    <ul>
        <li> We get a table and meet our Tabaxi server. A group of patrons prepares to leave the bar, and dumps the rest of their ale out on the floor and table before exiting. Looking around, we notice several other patrons: a halfling at the bar and a group of Scarlet Vigil members. </li> 
        <li> <a href="party.html#Nassirra">Nassirra</a> talks to the halfling and learns that the dumping of leftover ale is a custom at the tavern. </li>
        <li> <a href="party.html#Zieg">Zieg</a> approaches the Scarlet Vigil members and buys them two rounds of ale in exchange for information. He learns that orcs have been attacking from the Fetid Tangle to the south. They make snide comments about the place and joke about burning it to the ground. They say their elven captain, Vilandris, is making a mistake by ordering them to stay in Triboar, and that they should really take the fight to the orcs themselves.</li>
    </ul>
    <li> <a href="party.html#Zieg">Zieg</a> returns to the party and shares this information with us. We decide to go to Whitewood Palace and talk to Captain Vilandris ourselves. </li>
    <ul>
        <li> When we arrive, <a href="party.html#Zieg">Zieg</a> tells a guard that we were sent by Sir Grimleaf to speak with Captain Vilandris. The guard escorts us to the captain. </li>
        <li> We decide that <a href="party.html#L">"L"</a> should lead the discussion, and we enter what appears to be the captain's office. </li>

            </span><li> <span id="05/18/2019"> <a href="party.html#L">"L"</a> greets Vilandris, but is taken aback when he realizes that Vilandris is an elf. He nervously palms his dagger as he asks Vilandris about the orc attacks on Triboar and the nearby towns.</li>
            <li><a href="party.html#L">"L"</a>'s back begins to ache, and he loses self-control. He grabs his dagger. <a href="party.html#Zieg">Zieg</a> grabs his hand to prevent him from attacking the elf. <a href="party.html#Multimodal">Multimodal</a> interjects to provide the cover story that <a href="party.html#L">"L"</a> is champing at the bit for an opportunity to kill more orcs. <a href="party.html#Rasputin">Rasputin</a> pulls out his string of orc ears, entirely unsolicited, as proof of our prior encounter with orcs. <a href="party.html#L">"L"</a> regains his composure.</li>
            <li> Vilandris tells us that they sent scouts into the Fetid Tangle to investigate and are awaiting the return of one scout, Miranda. They warn that Elk's Crossing, a town that lies due east from Triboar under <a href="npcs.html#Razak">Razak</a>'s charge, has been under attack. In passing, Vilandris mentions something about a town healer.</li>
        </ul>
    </ul>
     <li> A well-dressed older woman enters the room. Her name is Ermina, and we realize that she is the mayor of Triboar. She seems scared. </li>
     <li> Two horns sound in the distance. Vilandris says the signal indicates the return of a scout. We acommpany Vilandris to the gate. </li>
     <ul>
         <li> The scout, Miranda, has a large crossbow bolt protrudcing from her shoulder. Vilandris pulls the bolt out and <a href="party.html#Zieg">Zieg</a> heals the gaping wound. </li>
         <li> She tells us that Elk's Crossing is under threat, and soon Triboar will be as well. Orcs approach from the north and east, and goblins from the south. The orcs are uncharacteristically organized and have harnessed powerful magics that they did not possess before, including something like telekinesis.</li>
         <li> We can tell Vilandris is hiding something. <a href="party.html#Multimodal">Multimodal</a> directly asks him what he is hiding, explaining that we need to know everything so we can protect the town. Vilandris says the orcs have been kidnapping humans only, and killing non-humans that they encounter.</li>
         <ul>
             <li><a href="party.html#Multimodal">Multimodal</a> and <a href="party.html#Zieg">Zieg</a> meditate on why humans would be a target. <a href="party.html#Multimodal">Multimodal</a> receives the divine insight that humans are uniquely capable of cross-breeding with other races and that this may be why they have been targeted.</li>
         </ul>
     </ul>
    <li> We speak with Vilandris, Ermina, and Miranda. We decide to stay in Triboar and defend the town against the coming attacks. We help evacuate civilians.</li>
    <li> We realize that there are no temples or churches in Triboar, and no clerics. We wonder who or what Vilandris was referring to previously when speaking of a town healer, and cast suspicion on the mayor.</li>
    <ul>
        <li> <a href="party.html#Nassirra">Nassirra</a> decides to investigate the mayor herself. She finds a gnome in town to talk with and asks him about the town's history with respect to the lack of places of worship in town. </li>
        <ul>
            <li> The gnome explains that Triboar was once segregated into three distinct towns on the basis of religion, which caused conflict between the towns. </li>
            <li> When the towns were unified, houses of worship were abolished to prevent conflict on the basis of religion in future. </li> 
        </ul>
        <li> The gnome's story appears to check out, and <a href="party.html#Nassirra">Nassirra</a> concludes that the mayor isn't someone to worry about. </li>

We can hear the battle outside the walls of the city. We encounter a few more prisoners along the way and free them. Shortly thereafter, we hear celebratory cheers from Triboar's forces as the orc army retreats.</li>
            </ul>
        <li> We arrive at the barracks on Tall Boar around sundown. We're exhausted and hungry. <a href="party.html#Zieg">Zieg</a> starts healing the wounded soldiers who have returned from battle. <a href="party.html#Multimodal">Multimodal</a> flags down an official to find a place for the humans we saved to stay and then helps <a href="party.html#Zieg">Zieg</a>. <a href="party.html#Un-Kell">Ün-Kell</a> finds a seat at the table to get food. <a href="party.html#Rasputin">Rasputin</a> meditates, and as he does his tattoo becomes visible. <a href="party.html#Multimodal">Multimodal</a> notices and feels concerned, but when <a href="party.html#Rasputin">Rasputin</a> catches her glance, she awkwardly breaks eye contact.
        <li> <a href="party.html#Nassirra">Nassirra</a> and <a href="party.html#L">"L"</a> try to gather intelligence from the soldiers. They ask the soldiers if they had any information to report about the strange magic (e.g., telepathy) the orcs used. Most of them had only encountered the orcs for the first time that fight and couldn't provide useful information. <a href="party.html#L">"L"</a> learns that the mayor and Captain Vilandris  are not present. We get slightly suspicious of that.</li>
        <li> We see Sir Grimleaf among the wounded, who lost an eye in the battle. <a href="party.html#Zieg">Zieg</a> helps stabilize his wounds. <a href="party.html#Un-Kell">Ün-Kell</a> asks about Miranda, the scout we met before the battle, and locates her. She and <a href="party.html#L">"L"</a> talk about the strange orcs. She explains that the orcs enjoy killing elves particularly, and kill other non-humans indiscriminately, but spare the humans and take them captive. </li>
        </ul>
    <li> We return to Whitewood Palace to see what else we can learn. We find Captain Vilandris in their office. <a href="party.html#L">"L"</a> tells them what we observed in battle and asks for more intelligence from Vilandris. They don't have much new information to share. </li>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="party.html#Multimodal">Multimodal</a> asks Vilandris whether they have heard anything about <a href="npcs.html#Razak">Razak</a>. Vilandris is not optimistic because Elk's Crossing was badly overrun; it is clear that <a href="npcs.html#Razak">Razak</a> is presumed dead. They also tell us that the mayor has taken refugees from the town to Phandalin for protection.</li>
        <li> <a href="party.html#Rasputin">Rasputin</a> is concerned about whether the orcs will return, and feels conflicted about leaving Triboar. Vilandris seems to think they will not return for some time because the orcs will need to rebuild their forces. They suggest that we can help by doing a favor, traveling to Elspire to communicate a request for more troops to the Argent Bastion. </li>
        <li>We return to the barracks for the night. <a href="party.html#Zieg">Zieg</a> and <a href="party.html#Multimodal">Multimodal</a> help the wounded overnight.</li>
    </ul>
    <li>The next morning, we prepare to take the road to Elspire. We try to find horses to borrow to make the journey easier, to no avail.</li>
</ul>
<h2><span id="Elspire">Elspire</span> </h2>
<ul>
<li> We travel by road throughout the day to reach Elspire. As we approach, we see the shining spire of Elspire in the distance, and the city's famous aurora overhead. As we get closer, the party is taken aback by the aurora's beauty, especially <a href="party.html#Multimodal">Multimodal</a>, who had never before seen it. 
<ul>
    <li> We press on to reach the city, and <a href="party.html#Nassirra">Nassirra</a> is particularly weary from the journey. We approach the gate and a guard calls out to us. 
    <ul>
        <li>He asks if we're registered, and we are very confused. He explains that adventuring parties register with the city. We are skeptical but he encourages us to inquire about it at the Bastion.</li>
        <li> He also informs us that we have been summoned to appear at Everjade Palace for an ongoing investigation. He is not able to tell us more details, except that we must appear on the 5th of next month.</li>
        <li> He then gives us directions to the Argent Bastion and we part ways.</li>
    </ul>
    <li> We approach the Bastion and notice guard towers around the perimeter. The aurora is particularly vivid here. A guard stops us, and <a href="party.html#L">"L"</a> explains our business in the capitol. He shows the guard Vilandris' seal on the document in our possession as proof. The guard allows us to proceed.
    <ul>
        <li> We enter the Bastion and see an Aasimar person of clear importance, a Grand Judge, surrounded by guards. She asks what we saw in battle, and we decide to trust her and tell her about the strange orcs that we encountered. We also mention <a href="npcs.html#Razak">Razak</a>, who we learn is a mutual acquaintance, and she notes <a href="party.html#Un-Kell">Ün-Kell</a>'s law blade. Using some kind of magic she sets an inscription of <a href="npcs.html#Razak">Razak</a>'s name on the blade alight.
        <ul>
            <li> The Grand Judge advises that we register as an adventuring party. We seem a bit hesitant but promise to look into it. We ask about lodgings in the area, and <a href="party.html#Zieg">Zieg</a> asks where he can find a bath house. She directs us to an inn called the Verdant Vester in the Harmony District. We thank her and part ways.</li>
        </ul>
    </ul>
    <li> We head to The Verdant Vester, where <a href="party.html#Rasputin">Rasputin</a> immediately orders a vodka. We feel uneasy about needing to register, especially <a href="party.html#Nassirra">Nassirra</a>, and decide to ask fellow adventurers who have registered how they feel about it. We ask the innkeeper where adventurers spend their time off in town, and the innkeep points out a party of adventurers eating together in the inn.
    <ul>
        <li> We approach the party, which consists of a dwarf, a halfling, and two other humanoids. <a href="party.html#L">"L"</a> offers to buy them a round of drinks if they'll answer some questions of ours. We ask whether they're registered, and they affirm. We ask what the benefits are, and it seems that citizenship, land ownership, and insurance/wealth distribution (distributing assets equally upon a hero's death).
        <li> We ask about etiquette and are told not to steal jobs that are spoken for by other adventuring parties.
        <li> We ask where we can obtain weapons and magic items. They patronize us about expecting to buy magic items in a shop. They recommend Grovetender's Sanctuary for animals (per <a href="party.html#Rasputin">Rasputin</a>'s inquiry, to find a mount), Boreal Arms in the Bronze District for weapons, Oaken Oddities for potions.
    </ul>   
     <li> We return to the Bastion and obtain temporary registration papers. We are told that registration takes several weeks.</li>
   </ul> 
</ul>
<h3 id="The Goliath Challenger">The Goliath Challenger</h3>
<ul>
    <li>As we leave, an old Goliath man accompanied by a human spots <a href="party.html#Un-Kell">Ün-Kell</a>, calls him "clanless" (presumably a Goliath slur), and challenges him to combat. He throws a white sword on the ground and instructs <a href="party.html#Un-Kell">Ün-Kell</a> to wield it.</li>
    <ul></span><span id="08/25/2019">
        <li><a href="party.html#Un-Kell">Ün-Kell</a> does not want to fight. He calls out to the older Goliath and asks "Who are you?", but the challenger only replies to tell him to pick up the sword.</li>
        <li><span class="combat"><a href="party.html#Un-Kell">Ün-Kell</a> grabs the sword and feels an unsettling cold sensation emanating from it. The sensation is eerily familiar. He charges at the older man, sword in hand. As he attacks, bitter cold from the blade radiates through him. The older man seems to be protected by some kind of radiant energy. While they fight, the older man says the sword is <a href="party.html#Un-Kell">Ün-Kell</a>'s birthright.</li>
        <li><a href="party.html#Un-Kell">Ün-Kell</a> defeats the older man, knocking him unconscious.</span></li>
        <li>His human companion approaches and introduces himself as Virien, and adjunct professor at a nearby university. He tells us that the older Goliath is named Vaurek, and that he has been searching for his long-lost son.</li>
        <li><a href="party.html#Zieg">Zieg</a> heals the fallen Goliath, who regains consciousness. He smiles and confirms that he believes <a href="party.html#Un-Kell">Ün-Kell</a> is his son.</li>
    </ul>
    <li>We go to Virien's apartment in the Sundial district. During this time, Vaurek and <a href="party.html#Un-Kell">Ün-Kell</a> tell each other about their respective lives. We learn that Vaurek comes from the Northern Goliath tribe. He had a wife, and an infant son who was kidnapped.</li>
    <ul>
        <li>He believes <a href="party.html#Un-Kell">Ün-Kell</a> is that long-lost infant son, because he was able to wield the white blade and survive. Vaurek's infant son was anounted by the god Ralthak.</li>
        <li>Vaurek is a cleric of Ralthak, and was forced into exile when worship of Ralthak became forbidden. It was during his exodus that Vaurek lost his wife and son. Vaurek left their side to find food, and when he returned his wife was dead, and his son was nowhere to be seen.</li>
    </ul>
    <li>After we get to Virien's apartment, we learn that he is eager to part ways with Vaurek now that his son has been found. He volunteers to help us with the research we want to do first.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="Hitting the Books">Hitting the Books</h3>
<ul>
    <li><a href="party.html#Multimodal">Multimodal</a> asks whether there is someone in Elspire who could help us determine <a href="npcs.html#Razak">Razak</a>'s fate. Virien refers her to a Dr. Cloudy at the university who is skilled in divination magic. He offers to bring us to the university. <a href="party.html#Multimodal">Multimodal</a> borrows <a href="npcs.html#Razak">Razak</a>'s lawblade from <a href="party.html#Un-Kell">Ün-Kell</a>, in case its connection to <a href="npcs.html#Razak">Razak</a> proves helpful. <a href="party.html#Multimodal">Multimodal</a>, <a href="party.html#Nassirra">Nassirra</a>, and <a href="party.html#Zieg">Zieg</a> set out to do some research.</li>
    <ul>
        <li>Virien brings the group to the Hausman Library, a three-story building on his university's campus. We encounter a halfling librarian who tells us that we should be able to find Dr. Cloudy in the library.</li>
        <li>We approach an old Tabaxi with gray fur, garbed with flowing robes. Virien introduces him to us as Dr. Cloudy, and we introduce ourselves to him in turn. <a href="party.html#Multimodal">Multimodal</a> asks whether he can help us determine what happened to our friend. We make an appointment to meet in his office after his next class.</li>
        <li>In the meantime, we research some topics in the library.</li>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="party.html#Multimodal">Multimodal</a> attempts to research <a href="lore.html#Necromancy">necromancy</a>, but does not find very much information, because it is a forbidden topic. She learns about three subschools of <a href="lore.html#Necromancy">necromancy</a>: necrolization, which sows decay, animacy, which reanimates the dead, and white <a href="lore.html#Necromancy">necromancy</a>, which preserves dead tissue to prevent decay.</li>
            <li><a href="party.html#Nassirra">Nassirra</a> and <a href="party.html#Zieg">Zieg</a> look into the strange magic-like combat we encountered in the field. They find an old book that has remained undisturbed for many years, in which they learn about <a href="lore.html#Psionics">psionics</a>. </li>
                <ul>
                    <li><a href="lore.html#Psionics">Psionics</a> come from a mysterious source, and unlike traditional magic they do not interact with a magical force known as the weave. Like traditional magic, <a href="lore.html#Psionics">psionics</a> requires focus and concentration to perform, but only requires somatic components whereas magic requires material components as well.</li>
                    <li><a href="lore.html#Psionics">Psionics</a> create forces that interact with the world, and come from the consciousness of the caster. They cannot be used by beings that lack consciousness. </li>
                </ul>
            <li>The group additionally researches three other topics, the <a href="lore.html#The Feywild">Feywild</a>, inter-planar travel, and the eye-stalks we saw in Wave Echo Cave.</li>
            <ul>
                <li>The <a href="lore.html#The Feywild">Feywild</a> is one of the four parallel planes alongside the material plane. It is a manifestation of positive emotion and the domain of life. It contrasts with the Shadowfell, a plane of negative emotion and the domain of death. The <a href="lore.html#The Feywild">Feywild</a>'s capricious nature poses hazards. Some have traveled to the <a href="lore.html#The Feywild">Feywild</a> only to get lost in its forests forever, or to dance unwillingly until they die.</li>
                <li>Travel between planes is dangerous. There are many layers of planes, most notably:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Parallel planes: the <a href="lore.html#The Feywild">Feywild</a>, Shadowfell, the <a href="lore.html#Astral Sea">Astral Sea</a>, and the Ethereal Plane.
                    </li>
                    <li>Inner planes:  e.g., the elemental chaos.
                    </li>
                    <li>Outer planes: correspond to moral alignments, good, evil, chaos, and lawful.</li>
                    <li>Additional planes: pure positive energy, pure negative energy, the nexus (City of Sigil), and an infinite continuum of demiplanes. The space between planes is the veil beyond.</li>
                </ul>
                <li>Travel is achieved through planar portals, where the veil between planes is thin. Natural leylines lead to portals, and can be followed to locate them. Portals can be created using high level spellcasting, which is difficult to cast and requires an item from the target plane.</li>
                <li>The City of Sigil is a hub of inter-planar travel and trade. It contains the Planar Causeway, a circle of teleportation portals that lead to different planes.</li>
                <li>The eyestalks are known as Spectators. They are children of nightmares found in the <a href="lore.html#Astral Sea">astral sea</a>, which is a realm of thought. Anything that has been thought exists in the <a href="lore.html#Astral Sea">astral sea</a>, including strange creatures and weird non-euclidean spaces. Spectators are a lesser type of Beholder, and they can make their way to the material plane under someone's will. We infer that the Spectators we encountered were being controlled by some other entity.</li>
            </ul>
        </ul>
        <li>By the time we finish our research in the library, several hours have elapsed and our meeting with Dr. Cloudy is nigh. Virien escorts us to Dr. Cloudy's office.</li>
        <ul>
            <li>We enter Dr. Cloudy's office and take a seat. He pulls out a small ornate mirror and asks for the name of our friend. <a href="party.html#Multimodal">Multimodal</a> gives him <a href="npcs.html#Razak">Razak</a>'s full name and lawblade. Dr. Cloudy hesitates. We intuit that he is concerned about the potential consequences of spying on someone of such a high rank, but he decides to proceed given that we are concerned for <a href="npcs.html#Razak">Razak</a>'s safety.</li>
            <li>Dr. Cloudy runs his hand along the blade and then enters some kind of trance, swaying back and forth. His eyes go blank. As he sees a vision, a blast of energy pushes him away from his desk.</li>
            <ul>
                <li>He tells us that <a href="npcs.html#Razak">Razak</a> is alive, but gravely injured. He sees him lying in a bed, and can hear the sound of waves from the ocean.</li> 
                <li>He is being cared for by a green-skinned man, perhaps a half-orc.</li>
            </ul>
            <li><a href="party.html#Multimodal">Multimodal</a> and <a href="party.html#Zieg">Zieg</a> thank Dr. Cloudy and tip him for his services, which he was willing to perform at no charge. </li>
            <li><a href="party.html#Zieg">Zieg</a> tells the group that he knows of a small fishing village, and suspects that may be where <a href="npcs.html#Razak">Razak</a> is, based tenuously on the vision and what he knows about the location of Elk's Crossing relative to the Fetid Tangle.</li>
        </ul>
        <li>While the group learned a great deal of information, some of the answers they found were unsatisfying. They decide to find a temple where they can do additional research.</li>
        <li>As they leave the library, <a href="party.html#Multimodal">Multimodal</a> spots another Firbolg on campus. She excitedly approaches the student, who is far less excited about the conversation. The student advises her to disguise herself as a human in certain, less-savory parts of the city. She thanks him for his advice, bids him good luck in his studies, and allows him to take his leave.</li>
        <li><a href="party.html#Nassirra">Nassirra</a> spots a half-elf teenager who gives off thief-like vibes. She decides to ask the teen about thieves guilds in town where she might be able to get the kind of information you don't find in books. In exchange for a few gold pieces, the teen tells her about the Larson Brothers laundry in the River District, where she can speak a code phrase "my eye wanders" for entry.</li>
        <li>We go to the Sun Sanctuary, a temple of Pelor that <a href="party.html#Zieg">Zieg</a> has made pilgrimage to in the past. There is a library there available only to servants of Pelor. </li>
        <ul>
            <li>We encounter Father Blackheart, an older dwarf gentleman that <a href="party.html#Zieg">Zieg</a> knows. He was promoted since he last saw <a href="party.html#Zieg">Zieg</a> and is now the archbishop, a very powerful position in the faith. He gives us his blessing to research whatever we like in the library, and to pick his brain.</li>
            <li><a href="party.html#Zieg">Zieg</a> investigates <a href="lore.html#Necromancy">necromancy</a> again here and finds far more information than we found at the university library. We find a book about the history of <a href="lore.html#Necromancy">necromancy</a> in Arkovia.</li>
            <ul>
                <li>An ancient ruler's royal mage dabbled in <a href="lore.html#Necromancy">necromancy</a>. The mage turned the king into an undead creature. The king retained his wits in undeath but devoured mortal flesh, and held a long reign of terror. </li>
                <li>An ancient ruler on another continent became a lich and destroyed the land. This pre-empted an exodus of a handfull of survivors who settled into Arkovia. Necromancy is highly stigmatized in Arkovia in part because it is considered an original sin in the story of Arkovia's settlement.</li>
                <li>In the start of the second era, the region surrounding present day Lucav was plagued by bloody wars. It was called the hollows, a "land awash in death". Goliath and Dwarven necromancers raised armies of the dead.
                </li>
                <li>In the late second era, a cult worshipped a deity of the Shadowfell who punished the wealthy and sinful ruling class. Worship of that deity has since been banned.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <li><a href="party.html#Multimodal">Multimodal</a> investigates the Eladrin, Na'Zandar's people.</li>
            <ul>
                <li>The Eladrin were indiginous to Arkovia, and the namesake of the city Elspire ("Elf Spire"). Originally dwelled in the <a href="lore.html#The Feywild">Feywild</a> and are considered ancestors of modern-day elves.</li>
                <li>The Eladrin became oppressive overlords over the first men of Arkovia (those who fled in the exodus), who successfully rebelled against them.</li>
            </ul>

<h3 id="Shop til You Drop">Shop 'til You Drop</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Meanwhile, <a href="party.html#Rasputin">Rasputin</a>, <a href="party.html#L">"L"</a>, and <a href="party.html#Un-Kell">Ün-Kell</a> decide to visit Oaken Oddities to get some sweet, sweet loot. </li>
        <ul>
            <li>Before hitting up the magic shop, the group gets some food with Vaurek, so that Vaurek and <a href="party.html#Un-Kell">Ün-Kell</a> can get a little bit of father-son bonding time. And meat.
            </li>
            <li>As they approach Oaken Oddities, they are confronted by a group of protestors bearing signs that read "Magic is Murder". They ask the protestors what all the fuss is about, and the protestors explain that the body parts of living things are used to craft magic items. <a href="party.html#Rasputin">Rasputin</a> pulls out the head of King Groll, a bugbear we defeated in one of our earlier encounters, and takes a long sniff of it to show that he is more than on board with killing creatures and using their body parts for whatever. The protestors look horrified, and allow the group to pass.</li>
            <li>Inside they see a whimsical shop where tiny wooden automata crawl along the walls and various other shop surfaces. The shop is run by a gnomish shopkeeper clad in bright colors, including brightly colored hair that transitions from pink to teal in color. She greets the group and asks what kind of price range they're able to accommodate.</li>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="party.html#Rasputin">Rasputin</a> expresses interest in items that would help him survive combat better. The shopkeeper brings out some bloody hand wrappings that catch his eye. In an attempt to barter, <a href="party.html#Rasputin">Rasputin</a> offers up the ankheg egg he has held on to since Wave Echo Cave. The shopkeeper regrets to inform him that the ankheg zygote is no more. It has ceased to be.</li>
                <li><a href="party.html#Un-Kell">Ün-Kell</a> is similarly interested in items that could grant him protection in combat, and perhaps swiftness. He offers to help "deal with" the protestors in exchange for a discount, but the shopkeeper seems unbothered by the protest. He ends up buying a magical charm that grants him temporary hitpoints when he kills an enemy.</li>
                <li>The shopkeeper tells them about various other items that are available, including force eggs, which are magical grenades that she apparently makes herself. <a href="party.html#Rasputin">Rasputin</a> expresses great interest in these. She also offers jewelry for sale, rings that protect the wearer from specific elements. Finally, she has several ritual spell scrolls that catch <a href="party.html#L">"L"</a>'s attention, and he purchases two spell scrolls, including one that creates a safe place for us to rest no matter where we are. He also purchases a ring to protect himself from poison and necrotic damage.</li>
                <li><a href="party.html#Rasputin">Rasputin</a> haggles with the shopkeeper, trading his magical Zivil stone toward the cost of the bloody wrappings and a magical sash.</li>
            </ul>
        </ul>
    </ul>
    <h3 id="Back to the Bastion">Back to the Bastion</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>We regroup back at the Argent Bastion. We communicate our findings and procurements to one another, then stop by the quartermaster. <a href="party.html#Zieg">Zieg</a> buys diamonds that he can use as material components to revive one of us if we fall in battle. We also note that the quartermaster stocks filters of lyceal, which can allow magic casters to regain their spellcasting capabilities without the need for a rest. They are very expensive.</li>
        <li><a href="party.html#Nassirra">Nassirra</a> wants to head to the River District to enter the thieves' guild the half-elf teen told her about. We decide to head there as a group.</li>
    </ul>
<h3 id="Where Thieves Break Through">Where Thieves Break Through</h3>
<ul>
    <li>We head south for several hours until we find ourselves in the River District near the evening. It stinks of fish and lumber, and the people we encounter are clearly no-nonsense. As the surroundings get seedier, <a href="party.html#Multimodal">Multimodal</a> disguises herself as a human to draw less attention. We ask a passerby for directions to the laundry.</li>
    <li>When we arrive at the laundry, <a href="party.html#Nassirra">Nassirra</a> tries to use the pass phrase on an employee outside with a laundry cart, but he seems confused. He says that we should talk to his boss, Christoff.</li>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="party.html#Nassirra">Nassirra</a> enters and speaks to Christoff, who tells her to speak to his brother. She and <a href="party.html#Un-Kell">Ün-Kell</a> head to a back room and meet a man who gives them a mysterious coin. The man directs them to go to a soda fountain across the street, order anything they want, and present the coin. He cautions that exactly two people must be present.</li>
        <li>They proceed across the street and are served by a halfling man. Upon seeing the coin, the gnome proceeds to make a drink. A Tiefling woman then ushers them off. She leads them to the thieves guild, blindfolded.</li>
        <li>A horrible smell wafts through the air, and <a href="party.html#Nassirra">Nassirra</a> suspects they are traveling through a sewer. Suddenly the Tiefling woman tells them to stop and hide. <a href="party.html#Nassirra">Nassirra</a> can barely make out three humanoids, and hears them talking about a woman in town, as though that is a situation they have people "on".</li>
        <li>After they leave, the Tiefling woman opens a secret door to a larger chamber where an Aasimar woman, dwarven woman, and the halfling man they ordered a drink from upstairs. The halfling man, Rolf, welcomes them to the Cistern of the Eye.</li></span>
        <span id="09/28/2019"><li>The Aasimar woman reveals herself as Yssa, the mechant who sold <a href="party.html#Zieg">Zieg</a> a luck stone in Phandalin. She tells <a href="party.html#Nassirra">Nassirra</a> that the thieves guild is an organization called "The Eye". <a href="party.html#Nassirra">Nassirra</a> has heard rumblings about the group, rumors of a spy organization, but no details.</li>    
    </ul>
    <li><a href="party.html#Nassirra">Nassirra</a> tries to gather some intel from Yssa about the threads we've been following. </li>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="party.html#Nassirra">Nassirra</a> asks about the orcs we encountered and proposes a mutually beneficial intelligence sharing arrangement. She says that the orcs are now doing strange magic that she does not think they have the intelligence to learn on their own. Yssa says that she knows about the war in the south and agrees intel is important, but is unwilling to divulge more, except to clarify that the orcs aren't too unintelligent to innovate but they are a very traditional culture, so it is strange that they have recently gone against their traditional means of combat. The Eye wants to know who is pulling their strings.</li>
    </ul>
    <li>Yssa says The Eye would be willing to share information if <a href="party.html#Nassirra">Nassirra</a> proves herself to to the organization. </li>
    <ul>
        <li>The Eye needs a new asset to go to Lucav and retrieve a tome from the House of Record that has information about the Markova family. Yssa promises to share information in exchange for the tome.</li>
        <ul>
            <li>The people of Lucav worship Zivilyn, a god of knowledge. Because knowledge is sacred to them, the House of Record serves as both a library and a temple. It is protected by guards and surveillance. </li>
            <li>The undead have been attacking Lucav in increasing numbers. During such an attack, we may have an opportunity to enter the House of Record unseen.</li>
        </ul>
        <li>The Eye also seeks a sample of the substance called Bloodstone, which is rumored to exist in the northwest corner of the continent.</li>
    </ul>
    <li>During <a href="party.html#Nassirra">Nassirra</a>'s conversation with Yssa, the tiefling who escorted her to The Eye pulls a blue luminescent ribbon from behind her ear and passes it to Yssa. <a href="party.html#Nassirra">Nassirra</a> intuits that this is some kind of magical information sharing system.</li>
    <li>Before parting ways, Yssa offers to sell off-market goods to <a href="party.html#Nassirra">Nassirra</a>, if she is interested. She buys some illicit drugs, poison, and a set of thieves tools.</li>
    <li>Finally, Yssa tells <a href="party.html#Nassirra">Nassirra</a> that she can contact us via the dwarven woman she met earlier. <a href="party.html#Nassirra">Nassirra</a> and <a href="party.html#Un-Kell">Ün-Kell</a> head take leave and return to the group.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="Hear Ye, Hear Ye">Hear Ye, Hear Ye</h3>

<ul>
    <li>On the street, we hear a town cryer advertising the upcoming King's Address. <a href="party.html#Zieg">Zieg</a> asks a nearby Tabaxi about it, who tells him that the King's Address is something of an announcement about the current state of the country, a bit of news bulletin. </li>
    <li><a href="party.html#Nassirra">Nassirra</a> and <a href="party.html#Un-Kell">Ün-Kell</a> rejoin the group and communicate what transpired with The Eye. We suspect the Eladrin might somehow be involved in the orc mischief. The rest of us relay information we just learned about the King's Address. We decide it might be worth listening to in order to get more information about the war, or at least to know what the King sees fit to tell his subjects about it.</li>
    <li>We decide that our next step should be to go to Lucav, given that several of the threads we're following lead there. There may be a boat of some kind that could get us there in the River District. Before we do, we decided to rest and plan our journey, and start heading to The Red Scale Restaurant & Inn. </li>
    <li>On our way to the inn, we encounter two people being pursued by a group of unsavory individuals. <a href="party.html#Zieg">Zieg</a>, <a href="party.html#Un-Kell">Ün-Kell</a>, <a href="party.html#Rasputin">Rasputin</a>, and <a href="party.html#L">"L"</a> rush after them.
</ul>

<h3 id="A Foul Wind">A Foul Wind</h3>
<ul>
    <li>We engage in combat with the bandits pursuing two individuals, a raven-haired man and a robed AAasimar. </li>
    <ul>
        <li>Some of the bandits are mystical magic casters and the others wield blades. <a href="party.html#Nassirra">Nassirra</a> climbs onto a nearby roof to get a better vantage point, and strikes one of the thugs with an arrow. As they attack, we notice that the mystics appear to attack with some sort of thunder ability.  <a href="party.html#L">"L"</a> commands the thugs to halt. A raven-haired man, one of the people being pursued, joins the battle. <a href="party.html#Rasputin">Rasputin</a> kills one of the mystics and wounds a fighter. <a href="party.html#Multimodal">Multimodal</a> summons a magical elk into the bandits' midst as a distraction. <a href="party.html#Un-Kell">Ün-Kell</a> flies into a rage and kills another mystic. Vaurek fights among us, but first heals himself as he had not yet recovered the health he lost when dueling <a href="party.html#Un-Kell">Ün-Kell</a>. The thugs band together and kill <a href="party.html#Multimodal">Multimodal</a>'s elk. <a href="party.html#Zieg">Zieg</a> blasts them with a fireball. Vaurek, <a href="party.html#Zieg">Zieg</a>, and <a href="party.html#Multimodal">Multimodal</a> heal the party. Within minutes, we whittle the group down to a sole surviving mystic, who we knock unconscious and decide to question later on. </li>
        <li>The people who were being pursued introduce themselves to us. The robed AAasimar calls herself Sarah and the raven-haired man gives us the name Ezra. <a href="party.html#Multimodal">Multimodal</a> suspects these are not their real names, and that the AAasimar woman is, or was, a member of high-society, now fleeing the city for reasons she can't divulge. <a href="party.html#Nassirra">Nassirra</a> suspects the AAasimar may be the woman who the armored men she encountered in the sewers were talking about. <a href="party.html#Nassirra">Nassirra</a> offers her protection, and uses The Eye's code language to test the waters. Sarah declines the offer.</li>
        <li>Sarah asks us whether we have seen a tiefling and a Tabaxi man together in town. We haven't, but Vaurek says he saw them years ago, possibly in the Soot District. He offers to take Sarah and Ezra to the place where he saw them last. We agree to part ways. Before we do, <a href="party.html#L">"L"</a> writes the name of our adventuring party in his book of shadows and tears off a piece of the page to give to Sarah. He explains that it is a piece of his soul, which she could use to find us again. As they leave, we realized that Ezra's eyes were closed the whole time, but we can see a faint blue light emanating from behind his eyelids.</li>
    </ul>
    <li>As we search the fallen bandits for items, we find strange tokens and wooden coins with fronds on them. We decide to take the unconscious mystic with us to the inn. We put a red cloak on him, remove his hood, and disguise tattoos on his face that might reveal his identity with makeup. We also put a wig on him, for later snatching. </li>
    <ul>
        <li>As we approach the inn, <a href="party.html#Rasputin">Rasputin</a> splashes liquor on the captive mystic so that he can pass for our sloppy drunk friend. Once inside, some frat boys fall for the ruse and sympathize with us. We manage to reserve a room.</li>
        <li>While we wait for our room, a large group enters the inn after us. There are humans and dwarves in the group, and reclusive people in loose-fitting robes with bone-like skin, horns or spikes protruding from their cheekbones, some have no eyes, others no mouth. We infer that this is some other race of people we have not encountered before. As a group, they appear to be injured and ill. </li>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="party.html#Zieg">Zieg</a> does what he can to help heal them. He asks them what happened. One of the dwarves says they just arrived from Lilygrove, located in The Hollows, which is a valley in the northeast where Lucav is. They are refugees of an undead attack in the region. <a href="party.html#Zieg">Zieg</a> buys food for them and heals the three most wounded members of the group. </li>
            <li>A survivor describes the undead attack. Undead attacks are not unusual in the spring, especially when mists creep in, but this one was unusual. An eerie melody played and mists creeped in over the town just before the undead descended on it, as though the melody summoned them. They fought with clawing and biting, and moved more quickly this year. The ranks of the Lucavi Knight patrols who defend the town have thinned in battle. He warns us to steer clear of Lilygrove. </li>
            <li><a href="party.html#Nassirra">Nassirra</a> and <a href="party.html#L">"L"</a> overhear the conversation. They approach and offer to help fight off the undead attacks. <a href="party.html#Zieg">Zieg</a> asks the refugee to draw a map for us. He gives us directions to Lilygrove: head east out of Elspire following the King's road, then turn north before we hit the coast. Follow the north road past Ashmore, a mining outpost, keep north and you will find Lilygrove.</li>
            <li>He tells us that the Lucavi Knights have special swords that help combat the undead, and are trained to fight them by a champion. <a href="party.html#Un-Kell">Ün-Kell</a> asks whether their blades are anything like his icy sword, but it seems not.</li>
        </ul>
        <li><a href="party.html#Rasputin">Rasputin</a> took the prisoner upstairs to our room. When the rest of the group meets him, he is staring down the prisoner and his skin has turned black. <a href="party.html#Zieg">Zieg</a> creates a Zone of Truth around the prisoner, says "You've got 10 minutes" to the group, then leaves the room. We wake the prisoner and begin questioning him. </li>
        <ul>
            <li>He seems to be a member of an air elemental cult. He says Sarah is part of some cult prophecy, something about bringing the masters from the heavens. <a href="party.html#Multimodal">Multimodal</a> summons a dust devil to show her own command of the elements and convince him to comply. He tells us that the cult leader, Favric, says the masters will come whether we want them to or not. Favric trains the cultists to be loyal and asks them for tribute. The prisoner doesn't know when the masters will come and says it's because we mortals can't possibly fathom their plans. He mentions the ruins of an old city near Westport. We recall mention of the ruins from <a href="lore.html#Journal">Hamun's journal</a>, a place called Thundertree. After divulging that information, the prisoner refuses to cooperate further. <a href="party.html#Multimodal">Multimodal</a>'s dust devil throws him out the window of the inn. </li>
            <li>A passerby in the hallway hears the commotion and asks <a href="party.html#Zieg">Zieg</a> what's going on. <a href="party.html#Zieg">Zieg</a> says what anyone says to justify horrible deeds, that we are doing the Lord's work.</li>
            <li>We decide we can't stay at the inn, since others saw us enter the inn with the cultist. We stealthily exit from the shattered window.</li>
        </ul>
        <li>We ask a stranger in the street for directions to the next nearest in, which is in the outskirts of the city. When we get there, we find that it's already fully booked, and the city is full of refugees from Elk's Crossing, Triboar, and Lilygrove. We head outside the eastern city gate and find a refugee tent city to blend in with. <a href="party.html#L">"L"</a> takes some time to transcribe a ritual into his book, then summons a tiny hut for us to safely rest in. We comfortably spend the night there. <a href="party.html#Nassirra">Nassirra</a> and <a href="party.html#Un-Kell">Ün-Kell</a> investigate the refugee situation in the city.</li>

    </ul>
</ul>

<h3 id="Travel Arrangements">Travel Arrangements</h3>

<ul>
    <li>We decide to stay in Elspire for the King's Address. <a href="party.html#L">"L"</a> decides to check in with a mercenary guild in town called The Silver Scabbard. <a href="party.html#Rasputin">Rasputin</a> decides to go with him. <a href="party.html#Zieg">Zieg</a> and <a href="party.html#Multimodal">Multimodal</a> go to the River District to hire a river boat to take us toward Lucav, then head to a bath house in the Harmony District.  </li>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="party.html#Nassirra">Nassirra</a> and <a href="party.html#Un-Kell">Ün-Kell</a> discover that the Scarlet Vigil has been deployed to use crowd control methods on refugees in the streets, and are not exactly treating them with kindness. They find no evidence of any other strange activity.</li>
            <li><a href="party.html#L">"L"</a> and <a href="party.html#Rasputin">Rasputin</a> head to the Silver Scabbard. An actual silver scabbard sits above the doorway, and they find mercenaries sharing war stories with one another. <a href="party.html#Rasputin">Rasputin</a>'s interest is piqued. <a href="party.html#L">"L"</a> shoots the shit with his half-orc contact, "K". Nearby, a dwarf female mercenary named "T" is deep in her cups. <a href="party.html#L">"L"</a> asks "K" what contracts are available. He says the Knights of Lucav are contracting fighters to defend the town. Supposedly there is a necromancer in the northern foothills sending undead to attack the town. <a href="party.html#Rasputin">Rasputin</a> decides to join the mercenary guild. He pays a fee and is assigned a number, #13. He gets a scabbard. Some chit-chat reveals that initiates get number identifiers, and higher ranked members get letters.</li>
            <li><a href="party.html#Zieg">Zieg</a> and <a href="party.html#Multimodal">Multimodal</a> head to the River District and approach the boatyard, where they find an older dark-skinned lady who introduces herself as a Jaina, captain of a riverfaring vessel. They tell her where our party is headed and she says she can take us to Karethra, a fishing village in the east, and we can head north from there. She offers us a rate of 3 gold per person for passage. They charter her boat under our adventuring party name (GRADS) to take us to Karethra the next day with an afternoon departure time. Then they head to the Harmony District and find a bathhouse called Afra's Well, named for the goddess Afra, who some would regard as a sister-goddess to Pelor. An Elf greets them as they enter the bathhouse and explain the packages available, rates, and rules. Customers must be nude, can have individual rooms or bathe in the common area, and there are some other perks. They opt to spring for the executive package at a rate of 3 gold 5 silver per person. Afterwards, they feel fuully rejuvenated.</li>

    <li><span id="11/02/2019">We regroup at the Verdant Vesture and prepare for the King's Address.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="State of the Kingdom">The State of the Kingdom</h3>

<ul>
    <li>We head to the Palace District to witness the King's Address, where we encounter a large crowd. There is a wall surrounding the Emerald Palace and surrounding areas where the aristocracy live, surely to keep out riff-raff like ourselves. Large government buildings loom, interconnected by bridges from upper floors, and there are magically powered cable cars traversing the sky. Obelisks with guards wearing cloaks like the one Daren Edermath wore are situated along the perimeter.</li>
    <li>The crowd gathers in a large square from which we can see the Emerald Palace. It reeks of body odor. <a href="part.html#Multimodal">Multimodal</a> and <a href="party.html#Nassirra">Nassirra</a> are uncomfortable with the number of people in the crowd.</li>
    <li>A woman garbed in a fancy blue and white dress robe takes the stage. She approaches a bronze crescent-shaped podium and speaks to the crowd with a booming voice, amplified by thaumaturgy. She introduces herself as Angara Mar, regent for the boy prince. Then she introduces the King and steps aside for him to speak.</li>
    <ul>
        <li>The King steps forward to address the crowd. He wears decorative green and gold garb, a gaudy crown, and a golden ceremonial breast plate. The Queen stands off to the side, adorned in beautiful robes. <a href="party.html#Zieg">Zieg</a> is starstruck at the sight of the royal couple. <a href="party.html#Nassirra">Nassirra</a> blows a raspberry. A nearby Dwarven citizen shoots her a dirty look.</li>
        <li>The King welcomes the crowd and proceeds to speak. </li>
        <ul>
            <li>He talks about the tragedy that befell his family, alluding to the death of his daughter, and states that his youngest child, his son and heir, is in good health.</li> 
            <li>He announces that the kingdom will soon be testing new airship technology and urges citizens not to be alarmed should they see the airships.</li>
            <li>He mentions the "tragedy" of <a href="npcs.html#Glasstaff">Glasstaff</a>'s death, which raises an eyebrow or two in our party. His death has left a power vacuum in the Lord's Round, leadership of the Lord's Alliance.</li>
            <li>The leader of an allied nation abdicated the throne, contributing to destablization in the region.</li>
            <li>He acknowledges the rumors of cultists causing chaos in the city and assures citizens that crime is low and they are safe.</li>
            <li>He acknowledges the refugees in the city from Triboar, Elk's Crossing, and Lilygrove, and bids his citizens to treat them with kindness and compassion.</li>
            <li>He begins to solicit volunteers to join the Scarlet Vigil in the war effort, but is cut off as a spire arrow strikes his breastplate, but appears to shatter harmlessly on imact. It looks like an assassination attempt. We notice that Angara Mar appears unphased by what transpired.</li>
        </ul>
        <li>We see someone dressed as a sentinel of the spire running off from the direction of the arrow.</li>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="party.html#Rasputin">Rasputin</a> attempts to pursue the would-be assassin but can't get through the crowd of panicking people in the square.</li>
            <li><a href="party.html#L">"L"</a> sends his familiar Bob after the assailant, and Bob quicky flies out of range of <a href="party.html#L">"L"</a>
's psychic connection with him.</li>
            <li><a href="party.html#Rasputin">Rasputin</a> is stopped at the gate by guards. He takes a swig from his flask and backtracks, then seeks out the rest of the party.</li>
            <li>We hear a bell ring loudly throughout the city and notice that everyone is on high alert. We are pushed out of the Palace District and into the Sundial District, along with the rest of the crowd.</li>
            <li>We find an alley way that's out of sight where <a href="party.html#L">"L"</a> resummons Bob to find out what he saw. Bob identifies the assailant as a man who ran across rooftops. <a href="party.html#L">"L"</a> asks him to draw a sketch of the man. Bob tries, but is an owl. The sketch is useless.</li>
        </ul>
    </ul>
</ul>

<h3 id="Change of Plans">Change of Plans</h3>
<ul>
    <li>We head to the River District to see whether we can still make our scheduled departure from the city. As we pass through the Sundial District, we see guards lining up refugees and interrogating them. We get the sense that the guards are looking for a scapegoat, and refugees are an easy target. <a href="party.html#Nassirra">Nassirra</a> considers getting rid of the cloak she found in Daren's residence after his untimely demise, to avoid suspicion for the crime. As we pass through the city, we learn that martial law is in effect, and no one is allowed to leave the city.</li> 
    <li>We make it to the River District where <a href="party.html#Multimodal">Multimodal</a> and <a href="party.html#Zieg">Zieg</a> lead the group to Jaina, the boat captain we made arrangements with. The boatyard is under heavy guard, and we see sailors barred from boarding their boats. Jaina is one of them. We ask her what's going on after she butts heads with a guard, and she pretends not to recognize is. She loudly announces that she needs a drink at the nearby tavern, The Soiled Skivvies, and shoots us a knowing glance. Just as the situation begins to escalate, we find the tavern and enter.</li>
    <ul>
        <li>The tavern is extremely busy and loud. We find Jaina and talk with her. She tells us what we already know for the most part, that the city is on lockwdown and there's no getting out, at least not without some serious spycraft. The city has been on lockdown before, she said, and it could be days before anyone is allowed freedom of movement.</li>
        <li>We mention the airships the King announced. She doesn't know anything useful to share with us, but we see a glint in her eye. She is excited about the technology.</li>
        <li>We ask her about the King's family based on what he mentioned in the speech, but she doesn't have much information.</li>
        <li>We formulate a potential plan. <a href="party.html#Multimodal">Multimodal</a> could disguise herself with Firbolg magic to look like a guard, and demand to board Jaina's boat for inspection. Then <a href="party.html#Zieg">Zieg</a> can create a fog cloud to obscure the rest of the party as they too board the vessel.</li>
        <li>We decide whether we want to stay in the city and follow leads or try to depart. Our plan to leave is very risky, and there are some interesting leads we could pursue in town. We decide to stay.</li>
    </ul>
</ul>

<h3 id="The Game is Afoot">The Game is Afoot</h3>
<ul>
    <li>We decide to split up and go back to our respective sources to find answers, if possible. <a href="party.html#Multimodal">Multimodal</a> and <a href="party.html#Zieg">Zieg</a> return to the temple to see Father Blackheart. <a href="party.html#L">"L"</a> and <a href="party.html#Rasputin">Rasputin</a> visit the Silver Scabbard. <a href="party.html#Un-Kell">Ün-Kell</a> and <a href="party.html#Nassirra">Nassirra</a> go back to The Eye to find out if there's another way out of the city, if we need to escape.</li>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="party.html#Nassirra">Nassirra</a> and <a href="party.html#Un-Kell">Ün-Kell</a> go back to the soda shop they visited previously to get to The Eye. They see a large crowd of people and are told that The Eye is at capacity with other citizens turning to their services in a panic.
        </li>
        <li><a href="party.html#L">"L"</a> and <a href="party.html#Rasputin">Rasputin</a> go to the Silver Scabbard and find it to be almost completely empty. Only "Z", a dragonborn mercenary known to <a href="party.html#L">"L"</a>, remained behind. He tells them that the bells ringing means there's a criminal at large, and the mercenaries are out for the bounty. "Z" comes across as an unintelligent meathead, but <a href="party.html#L">"L"</a> knows it's one of "Z"'s cons.
        </li>
        <li><a href="party.html#Zieg">Zieg</a> and <a href="party.html#Multimodal">Multimodal</a> return to the Sun Sanctuary. We ask Father Blackheart to commune with Pelor to get information about the assassination attempt. He performs a ritual at the altar, looks upon the sun symbol of Pelor committed to stained glass, and receives Pelor's word. We ask three yes/no questions of Pelor.
        </li>
        <ul>
            <li>Was the assassination attempted staged? Pelor says <span style="font-weight: bold; color: #ff9900; font-style:italic;">no.</span></li>
            <li>Is the assassin still in Elspire? <span style="font-weight: bold; color: #ff9900; font-style:italic;">Yes.</span></li>
            <li>Was anyone currently in the Lord's Round party to Ian Albreck's wicked schemes? <span style="font-weight: bold; color: #ff9900; font-style:italic;">Yes.</span></li>
        </ul>
