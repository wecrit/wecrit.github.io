                   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Archmage Champion overseeing the defense of Lucav. Artorious put out a <a href="events.html#Travel Arrangements">call for mercenaries</a> to kill a necromancer in the nearby hills, which the party answered. He <a href="events.html#Not My Champion">revealed himself to be a vampire</a> after <a href="party.html#Zieg">Zieg</a> detected that he is an undead creature. He sent the party to the Riovannes house on a mission and then tried to kill us, first by burning down the Riovannes house while we were inside, and then descending on the party and attacking us when we discovered his lair.
