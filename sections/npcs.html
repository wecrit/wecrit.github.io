                   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Traitor to Phandalin, masqueraded as Lord Albrek, ally of Sildar, but secretly worked for The Spider as the evil mage Glasstaff.

The party rescued him from the Cragmaw goblin cave, and he sided with us when we revealed his "friend" Lord Albrek to be the traitor, Glasstaff. We fought beside him in the <a href="events.html#Attack on Phandalin">Attack on Phandalin</a>. He has since become <a href="party.html#Multimodal">Multimodal</a>'s protection fighting mentor.

Involved in human trafficking for a mysterious purpose, and the use of necromantic arts of some kind. He tried to persuade us to join his cause in <a href="events.html#Wave Echo Cave">Wave Echo Cave</a>, but we adamantly refused. We decided he was too dangerous to allow to live, and put him out of our misery.
